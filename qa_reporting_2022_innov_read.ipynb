It will bring together big data on rangelands, source data including exploring crowd-sourcing and be an interactive platform for producing reports and trends for multiple users including UN Agencies monitoring rangeland and development agencies and actors developing interventions for rangelands, researchers and academics, and ultimately pastoralists themselves.\",\n",

      "The Global Rangelands Data Platform project aimed to establish the first online global data platform for monitoring rangelands and consolidating rangeland data. The project was led by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and GMV, and was awarded $100,000 by the CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture through the Inspire Challenge 2020. \n",

      "The project began by analyzing existing geospatial platforms to help inform the development of the Rangelands Data Platform. Meetings were held with FAO and GEOGLAM to learn about the architecture and design decisions behind their platforms, Earth Map and RAPP Map. This analysis indicated that a cloud-based solution using Google Earth Engine for storage and processing capabilities would be optimal for meeting user requirements.  \n",
      "\n",
      "To gather stakeholder input, an online survey was conducted which received 77 responses. The results showed high demand for long time series of climate, land use, livestock, and environmental data at national and regional levels to assess trends and changes in rangelands. Users also requested capabilities to process and download data. \n",
      "\n",
      "In May 2021, the project launched a Rangelands Atlas on the website www.rangelandsdata.org as an initial step toward the full data platform. The Atlas combines a basemap of rangeland ecoregions with publically available datasets on topics like protected areas and land degradation. Its launch received significant publicity and was presented at events like the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration.\n",

The project has moved beyond the ideation, basic research, formulation, and proof of concept stages. The project team has analyzed existing geospatial platforms, conducted an online survey to gather stakeholder input, and launched a Rangelands Atlas as an initial step toward the full data platform. The structure for the Rangelands Data Platform has been outlined, including a Google Earth Engine backend for cloud storage and processing, and a Mapbox or open-source TerriaJS frontend for visualization. However, the full launch of the Rangelands Data Platform is pending secure funding for maintenance and upkeep. Therefore, the project has not yet moved into the 'Model/Early Prototype' stage, where the innovation would be validated for its ability to achieve a specific impact under fully-controlled conditions.\"}\n"
