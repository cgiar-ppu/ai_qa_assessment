For five years the \\nPlatform team has been guided by the conviction that data standards, tools, \\nopen science infrastructure, digital partnerships and technical communities \\nof practice, and applied digital innovation can build powerful capabilities for \\naccelerating impact in agricultural research for development. As a result, this \\nreport points to some cumulative results of this efforts and signals some areas \\nwhere Platform investments will continue to grow in other parts of the One \\nCGIAR portfolio. \\nThere is depth and complexity to manage at the intersection of digital \\ntechnologies and agriculture; technical collaboration is essential in research \\nfor development, and the Platform has shown that CGIAR has important roles \\nto play. The Platform built wide awareness around the importance of Open \\nand FAIR data assets and standards as a foundation for digital transformation \\nin agri-food, delivering critical tools to help scientists discover, reuse, and \\ncollaboratively analyze data. It built CGIAR’s convening power, coalescing public, \\nprivate, and non-profit stakeholders around a technical agenda for digital \\ninnovation in agricultural development. The Platform’s technical Communities \\nof Practice (CoPs) boast 6,500 members, meeting a growing demand for CGIAR \\nengagement. The Platform sparked cross-boundary collaborations in areas \\nincluding artificial intelligence and risk in agricultural supply chains, inclusivity \\nin digital technologies, leveraging call records to study women’s economic \\nempowerment, and linking ethical data guidelines to technology standards. In \\ntotal, the Platform’s annual Conventions have engaged 5,500 attendees and \\nour communications reached several million stakeholders.', metadata={'source': '/home/ubuntu/data/2022/1037/ANNUAL REPORT BIG DATA 2021_XH 22 oct.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='6\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021In 2021 the Platform oversaw development and final delivery of the CGIAR \\nOpen and FAIR Data Assets Policy  through a consultative process to \\nformalize Open and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable data \\ntowards a mature data science-driven CGIAR.

The Global Coalition will ensure data and digital technologies are used to their fullest \\npotential to drive public good climate, biodiversity, nutrition, and development outcomes through food systems \\ntransformation. \\nThe Why: We believe data and digital innovations are fundamental to transforming the food system into a \\nfuture state that is universally accessible, sustainable, and resilient. The global food system intersects with multiple \\nchallenges facing humanity including climate change, environmental degradation, biodiversity loss, nutritional \\ninsecurity, and social inequities. To address these challenges effectively, we believe that we must overcome \\nfragmentation within and across sectors to act in a transdisciplinary fashion, bringing together the natural and social \\nsciences with data and technology to drive food systems towards more favorable potential futures for humanity and \\nthe planet. It is a matter of urgency. \\nThe How: We agree to the following principles for data and digital innovation in the service of food systems \\ntransformation. \\n• Build an inclusive digital revolution:  We recognize inequities in access and use of data and digital \\ninnovations and we strive to understand and design for human needs in order to foster solutions and \\npartnerships that reflect the diversity and complexity of food systems.\\n• Foster data agency and responsible sharing:  We support the agency of data owners to share data, \\nat all levels across the system while supporting the responsible use of data to unlock broader insights and \\ndrive accountability to sustainability goals. \\n• Be force multipliers: We seek to collaborate across sectors, disciplines, and alliances, supporting a \\ndiversity of data and digital solutions to address the needs of the many food systems in the world. \\n• Iterate and share learnings: We are biased towards action; we share data, evidence, and knowledge as \\nwe iterate to come to the best solutions. \\n• Innovate responsibly: We are stewards of data and technologies that may impact billions of people. We \\ncommit and recommit regularly to ethical action, agile governance, and collaborative learning. \\nPartners:  Mercy Corps, Consumers International, World Bank, FAO, CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture, \\nJohn Hopkins University, Google, World Economic Forum, the 50x2030 initiative, GEOGLAM, X Moonshot factory, \\nDigital Green, the Kenya Agricultural Transformation Office, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Pinduoduo, and AI4AI.', metadata={'source': '/home/ubuntu/data/2022/1037/ANNUAL REPORT BIG DATA 2021_XH 22 oct.pdf', 'page': 10}), Document(page_content='12\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021detailed annex\\nCollaboration with the GENDER Platform\\nThe Platform team continued to support CGIAR and GENDER efforts to make gender data more \\ndiscoverable and interoperable, and necessary capability for conducting multidisciplinary research \\nand the intersection of gender and food, land, and water systems. \\nCollaborative research with the GENDER Platform built on interesting research results using \\nanonymized call detail records (or “CDRs”--many billions of data points generated by the operation \\nof mobile phone networks) to examine some widely accepted indicators for women’s economic \\nempowerment in agriculture to explore these at a national scale in Uganda in a matter of a few weeks. \\nThis research, done in collaboration with the Gender Platform, resulted in a new research collaboration \\nfurther developing CDR-based methods for gender research that launched in 2021.

The Platform led strategic research informing the content and structure \\nof the new Digital Services unit under One CGIAR, underwent an external evaluation that found \\nPlatform offerings were relevant to an array of stakeholders, and commissioned an evaluation of the \\nInspire Challenge to examine how CGIAR can serve as an effective “bridging institution” for sourcing, \\nfostering, and scaling digital agri-food innovation.', metadata={'source': '/home/ubuntu/data/2022/1037/ANNUAL REPORT BIG DATA 2021_XH 22 oct.pdf', 'page': 19}), Document(page_content='21\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 20212.5 Efficiency\\nThe Platform’s Communities of Practice began to grow dramatically once a few key metrics \\nwere implemented related to the number of collaborative products and communications they \\ngenerated, in the context of a collaborative and validated annual workplan. Communities of Practice \\nare notoriously difficult to build and maintain, but the BIG DATA communities continued to grow \\nthroughout 2021, from 5,000 members to over 6,500. Under Module One the GARDIAN ecosystem \\nwas linked more directly to a new initiative under One CGIAR, and this accelerated progress towards \\nanchoring it in more specific user needs. These are important learnings related to harnessing the \\nbreadth and depth of CGIAR domain expertise and making the digital revolution central to our way \\nof working.\\n2.6 Management of Risks to Your Platform\\nThe Platform for BIG DATA continued to operate in a fluid context characterized by significant \\norganizational change and some continued disruption from the COVID-19 crisis. To manage \\noperational risks, some exceptional no-cost extensions were granted to projects needing a few extra \\nmonths to deliver. To navigate organizational change, the Platform team participated actively in \\ndesign groups for One CGIAR, spanning a majority of research initiatives and providing input to the \\nnew Digital Services design and establishment.\\n2.7 Use of W1-2 Funding\\nThe final year of the Platform was also a year of intensive design of the new One CGIAR research \\nportfolio as well as intensive transition planning. The Platform team led One CGIAR Transition Task \\nTeams related to data and transitional capabilities for research while contributing to the design of \\nseveral new research initiatives. The UN Food Systems Summit provided an important vehicle for \\ncoalescing public, private, and non-profit stakeholders around sourcing, fostering, and scaling digital \\nagri-food innovations, and the Platform was instrumental in the formation of the UN FSS- linked \\n“Global Coalition for Digital Food Systems Innovation.”', metadata={'source': '/home/ubuntu/data/2022/1037/ANNUAL REPORT BIG DATA 2021_XH 22 oct.pdf', 'page': 20}), Document(page_content='22\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\\nN/A', metadata={'source': '/home/ubuntu/data/2022/1037/ANNUAL REPORT BIG DATA 2021_XH 22 oct.pdf', 'page': 21}), Document(page_content='23\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\\nlist of tables\\nTable 2:  Condensed list of policy contributions in this reporting year  \\n (Sphere of Influence) 24\\nTable 3:  List of Outcome/Impact Case Reports from this reporting year  \\n (Sphere of Influence) 25\\nTable 4:  Condensed list of innovations by stage for this reporting year 26\\nTable 5: Summary of status of Planned Outcomes and Milestones  \\n (Sphere of Influence-Control) 27\\nTable 6: Numbers of peer-reviewed publications from current reporting period 40\\nTable 7: Participants in CapDev Activities 40\\nTable 8: Key external partnerships 41\\nTable 9: Internal Cross-CGIAR Collaborations 42\\nTable 10: Monitoring, Evaluation, Learning and Impact Assessment (MELIA) 43\\nTable 11: Update on Actions Taken in Response to Relevant Evaluations 45\\nTable 13: Platform Financial Report 46\\nTable Annexes 47', metadata={'source': '/home/ubuntu/data/2022/1037/ANNUAL REPORT BIG DATA 2021_XH 22 oct.pdf', 'page': 22}), Document(page_content='Title of policy, \\nlegal instrument, \\ninvestment or \\ncurriculum to which \\nCGIAR contributedDescription of policy, legal \\ninstrument, investment or \\ncurriculum to which CGIAR \\ncontributedLevel of \\nMaturityLink to sub-IDOsCGIAR cross-cutting marker score\\nLink to OICR\\nGender Youth CapDevClimate \\nChange\\n632 - Near Real-Time \\nData in Support of \\nNational Fisheries \\nStrategy in Timor LesteThe PeskAAS system was \\nused to provide data for \\ndrafting of the new fisheries \\nstrategy and law, and is now \\nintegrated into fisheries \\nmanagement decision-\\nmaking.Stage 2 yEnhanced institutional \\ncapacity of partner research \\norganizations\\n yEnhanced conservation of \\nhabitats and resources1 - \\nSignificant1 - \\nSignificant2 - \\nPrincipal1 - \\nSignificantOICR3874\\n795 - CGIAR Open and \\nFAIR Data Assets PolicyThe CGIAR Open and Fair \\nData Assets Policy clarifies \\nexpectations regarding \\nthe management and \\ndissemination of data assets \\nto ensure they are as open as \\npossible, FAIR, and managed \\nresponsibly.Stage 1 yEnhanced institutional \\ncapacity of partner research \\norganizations\\n yIncreased capacity for \\ninnovations in partner \\nresearch organizations? - Too \\nearly to tell? - Too \\nearly to tell2 - \\nPrincipal1 - \\nSignificantThe OFDA Policy \\nwas drafted by \\nCABI and revised \\nand delivered \\nby the Big Data \\nPlatform.

The Global \\nCoalition will ensure data and digital technologies are used to their fullest potential to drive public good climate, biodiversity, nutrition, and development \\noutcomes through food systems transformation. \\nThe Why:  We believe data and digital innovations are fundamental to transforming the food system into a future state that is universally accessible, \\nsustainable, and resilient. The global food system intersects with multiple challenges facing humanity including climate change, environmental degradation, \\nbiodiversity loss, nutritional insecurity, and social inequities. To address these challenges effectively, we believe that we must overcome fragmentation within \\nand across sectors to act in a transdisciplinary fashion, bringing together the natural and social sciences with data and technology to drive food systems \\ntowards more favorable potential futures for humanity and the planet. It is a matter of urgency.  \\nThe How: We agree to the following principles for data and digital innovation in the service of food systems transformation.  \\n• Build an inclusive digital revolution:  We recognize inequities in access and use of data and digital innovations, and we strive to understand and \\ndesign for human needs, fostering solutions and partnerships that reflect the diversity and complexity of food systems.\\n• Foster data agency and responsible sharing:  We support the agency of data owners to share data, at all levels across the system while supporting \\nthe responsible use of data to unlock broader insights and drive accountability to sustainability goals. \\n• Be force multipliers: We seek to collaborate across sectors, disciplines, and alliances, supporting a diversity of data and digital solutions to address \\nthe needs of the many food systems in the world. \\n• Iterate and share learnings: We are biased towards action; we share data, evidence, and knowledge as we iterate to come to the best solutions. \\n• Innovate responsibly: We are stewards of data and technologies that may impact billions of people. We commit and recommit regularly to ethical \\naction, agile governance, and collaborative learning. \\nPartners:\\nMercy Corps, Consumers International, World Bank, FAO, CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture, John Hopkins University, Google, World Economic \\nForum, the 50x2030 initiative, GEOGLAM, X Moonshot factory, Digital Green, the Kenya Agricultural Transformation Office, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, \\nPinduoduo, and AI4AI.\\nCollaboration with the GENDER Platform\\nThe Platform team continued to support CGIAR and GENDER efforts to make gender data more discoverable and interoperable, and necessary capability for \\nconducting multidisciplinary research and the intersection of gender and food, land, and water systems.', metadata={'source': '/home/ubuntu/data/2022/1037/ANNUAL REPORT BIG DATA 2021_XH 22 oct.pdf', 'page': 46}), Document(page_content='FP Detailed Annex\\nM2: Convene Collaborative research with the GENDER Platform built on interesting research results using anonymized call detail records (or “CDRs”--many billions of \\ndata points generated by the operation of mobile phone networks) to examine some widely accepted indicators for women’s economic empowerment in \\nagriculture to explore these at a national scale in Uganda in a matter of a few weeks.

This has led to poorly  planned  \\ninvestments,  particularly  in pastoralist  areas  which,  in many  cases,  has damaged  rather  than \\nstrengthened  the resilience  of communities.  \\nThe project  Building  Resilience  in Rangeland  Communities  with Big Data, led by ILRI and \\ntechnologically  supported  by GMV,  was selected  as a pilot project  winner  in the CGIAR’s  Inspire  \\nChallenge  2020  and provided  with an award  of US$100,000.  This project  planned  to establish  \\nthe first-ever online  global  Rangelands  Data Platform,  agreed upon by  global actors,  for \\nmonitoring  rangelands  and consolidating  rangeland  data,  including  ecosystem  health,  change,  \\nrisks,  and restoration  opportunities.  It is anticipated  that this Rangelands  Data Platform  will \\nserve  as the “go-to” information  source  on rangelands,  with data made  publically  available.  The \\ninformation  on land use change  and restoration  will be particularly  important  for guiding  global  \\nand national  investments  in rangelands  better  building  the resilience  of communities  to shocks  \\nand stresses,  and for global  and advocacy  work related  to this. Such  global  data are vital for use \\nin global processes and initiatives such as the UN D ecade on Ecosystem Restoration , the \\nanticipated International Year  of Rangelands  and Pastoralists  as well as for development  \\nagencies  such as IFAD  and advocacy  networks  such as Livestock  Data for Decisions  (LD4D).  \\nThe primary  and end beneficiaries  of this project  are pastoralists  and agro-pastoralists  who will \\nbenefit from more informed, better planned and better value -for-money investments in  \\nrangelands.  It is also anticipated  that eventually  pastoralists  and other  rangeland  users  will \\nbenefit  from and use the data itself,  though  how to best present  the data for such use needs  to \\nbe further  developed.  National  governments,  national  research  centres  and local pastoralist  \\nnetworks  are also key partners.  \\nIn the early  months  of the project,  concerns  were  raised  by those  involved  in the project  about  \\nsetting up a Platform without confirmed funds for upkeep and maintenance of that Platform,  \\nwhich  is not yet the case.

This Atlas  was launched  in May, in the week  leading  up to the launch  of the UN Decade  of \\nEcosystem Restoration. The Atlas was presented as a collaboration between ILRI, FAO, IUCN,  \\nWWF,  UNEP  and the ILC Rangelands  Initiative,  as well as the Livestock  and PIM CRPs,  and the \\nBig Data Platform  and contributing to  the UN Decade  of Ecosystem  Restoration.  \\nThe Atlas  is also on line, as a project  of the global  Rangelands  Data Platform.

We requested  to the potential  user of \\nthis platform to answer a short 14 -question survey on what they would like from such a  \\nplatform. Few more optional technical questions were also provided in addition to better  \\ndefine  the IT design  of the platform.  \\nThe networks  contacted  include  the AfriCul tuReS  community,  the Grassland  Dialogue  Platform,  \\nIFAD  GeoGroup,  IFAD  country  directors,  FAO EarthMap  developers,  GEOGLAM  RAPP  \\ndevelopers,  the FAO Pastoralist  Knowledge  Hub and FAO,  ESA and IFAD  staff directly  involved  in \\nrangelands  management.  The questionnaire  and the summary  of responses  is provided  in \\nAnnex  2. The responses  tailored by  the most represented  user groups are also  provided  as \\nreference  Annex  3. \\nThe survey  received  77 responses  (by 10th November  2021).  40% of the responses  came from  \\nacademia.  Government  bodies,  NGOs  and international  agencies  cover  almost  equally  other  \\n30% of the total responses.  \\nThe questionnaire  offered  a long list of services  that could  be available  in the future  platform.  \\nThe greatest  interest  was on having  global  datasets  to assess  the current  status  and trends  in \\nrangelands . In particular, data to monitor environmental trends and land use dynamics in  \\nrangelands  were the most demanded.  According  to the statistics  the information  about  trends  \\nin livestock numbers is also very relevant for the respondents. 70 -80% of the responses to the  \\nsurvey  cover  those  topics.  \\nWorth  noting  that 60% of the respondents  are also interested  in a repository  of information  \\nabout  rangelands,  and in having  the possibility  to self-process  data and maps . \\nIt is remarkable  that all the options  receive  support  from at least 35% of the participants.  \\nTogether  with the already  mentioned, highest preferences  for governmental employees also  \\ninclude verification of national datasets and data for improvement reporting for \\ninternational/national  commitments.  NGOs  find also of interest  advocacy  and lobbying , and \\ncrowd -sourcing  of data. \\nThese  needs  are reinforced  by the answers  given  by the participants  to the question  on their \\nwillingness  to use certain  datasets  from a list of pre-selected  ones.  90% of the participants  \\nrespond  that they would  use information  on livestock  distribution  and routes , and land use', metadata={'source': '/home/ubuntu/data/2022/1037/BuildingResilienceBigData.pdf', 'page': 10}), Document(page_content='land cover  (LULC)  current  status  and trends . Data on climate  projections  were also of interest  \\nfor near 65% of respondents.  Worth  noting  that soil erosion  is of great  interest  for \\ngovernments  and conflicts  relevant  for NGOs  and international  agencies.  \\nAll responses  were selected  by, at least,  20% of the participants.  \\nPotential  users  demand  data and information  to be available  in the platform  at country  level . \\nInformation at  regional  administrative boundaries in -country  and across country  are also \\nrelevant  for more  than half of the participants.  \\nRegarding  the question  about  the highest  interest  questions  to be answered  for understanding  \\nrangelands, many respondents mentioned changes in land use in rangelands, analysing  \\ndegradation  in rangelands  due to overgrazing  and climate , how climate change is impacting  \\nrangelands and livestock, information about livestock population and carrying capa city, and  \\nwhere  the rangelands  are. \\nAbout  the trends  to follow,  again  dynamics  of livestock  and land use are the most repeated  \\nanswers. Worth also mentioning climate change impacts and trends of vegetation cover,  \\nrangelands  degradation,  demography and  biomass . \\nOn the data to be provided  by the platform,  there  are many  different  requests  for very different  \\npurposes. The key words are: trends, change, livestock, regular updates, land use, soil,  \\ndegradation,  rehabilitation,  maps.  That might  be synthetized  in a platform  hosting  geospatial  \\ndata (maps)  to analyse  trends,  changes  and degradation  on livestock,  land use and soil with \\nregular updates  for rehabilitation  purposes. However,  note that many  other  applications  are \\nrequested. Flexibility is a must in the platform in order to respond to the needs and  \\nexpectations  from the different  rangelands  communities.  \\nThe most mentioned  uses for the data and services  requested  in the previous  questions  are for \\npolicy  development,  research,  impact  analysis,  education,  investment  planning  and advocacy.  \\nThe question  regarding  the data to be collected  at national  level to consolidate  global  products  \\nfollows  the previous  responses.  Trends  on LULC,  livestock  and land degradation . Land  \\nproductivity,  biomass  and vegetation  cover  have also relevance  in the answers.  \\nHalf of the participants  would  have interest  in uploading  local  data to the platform.  That \\nincludes photos,  reports  and national  datasets in  tabular,  raster  or vector  data. \\nMost of the respondents do not use any web -based platform to get information about  \\nrangelands.  The answers  including  platforms  refer to national  catalogues  or multi-purpose  \\ngeospatial  platforms.  \\nThe platform  design  should  focus  in computer -based  deployment.  Near all the answers  \\nrequested support for  computers. 30%  request  a mobile  visualization too.  \\nShort films are not of interest for the community, however local case studies, guidelines and  \\nfacts/figures are all requested. \\nNo conclusive  answer  with respect  to the rangelands  bulletin  subscription.', metadata={'source': '/home/ubuntu/data/2022/1037/BuildingResilienceBigData.pdf', 'page': 11}), Document(page_content='Data from weather  stations  network  and/or  in-situ measurements  are relevant  for nearly  all the \\nparticipants.  \\nNear 60% of the respondents  accepted  to continue  with the technical  questions.  \\nRegarding  the preferred  visualization  in the platform,  the most common  answer  is maps . On \\nthe visualization  options  there  is no consensus.  All the pre-defined  options  seem  to be of \\ninterest  for the community,  but the preference  is the trend  analysis . Note that this is linked  to \\nthe requirements  stated  in previous  questions  where  analysis  of trends,  dynamics  or changes  \\nwere  highly  demanded.  \\nThe most requested  frequency  updates  for the data hosted  in the platform  are 6-months  and \\nannual . \\nThe community  requested  data,  at least,  from the beginning  of the century  in order  to assess  \\nchanges  (last 20 years ). If possible  30 years  or more.  \\nOn the spatial  aggregation  the participants  indicate  their interest  in averages  at district  and \\ncatchment  level,  and information  at either  10m or 1km depending  on the product.  This is very \\nrelevant to design the platform because having very high resolution products at global level  \\nfor long time  series  drives  the platform  concept  selection.  The storage capability  of the \\nplatform  server  is then one of the deciding  factors.  \\nAll options  presented  to query  data are well received  by the rangelands  community.  \\nNot very demanding time response for data visualization and processing. Majorit y voted the  \\nmost  conservative  option.  \\nThe feature  to download  data is a must  for the potential  users  of the platform.  They  mostly  \\nrequested tabular data and maps . A third of the respondents would like to download raster  \\ndata.  \\nMore  than 80%  of the responses  indicate  their preference  to be able to process their  own \\nproducts . Results disaggregated by  user group  offer the same numbers . This feature is  not \\nonly of interest  for academia,  but also relevant  for Governmental  members,  NGOs  and \\ninternational  agencies.  Processing  capabilities  should  then be available  in the platform  to do, at \\nleast,  statistical  processing  and data layer  merging . Pre-processing  maps  instead  of trends  and \\ndynamics of  different  variables  do not seem  to be a good  option.

There  is no quorum  in the main \\nobjectives  and purposes  the Platform  should  follow,  being  in addition  all the services  and \\ndatasets  proposed  by ILRI and GMV  of interest for  the users. Some  conclusions  can be extracted  \\nby summarising  the results,  but the key issue  to be addressed  in the platform  design  is the \\nplatform  capability  to satisfy  as many  needs  as possible.  Worth  noting  that this would  be only \\npossible  by giving  the user sufficient  options  and features  to customize  the visualization  and \\ndata creation  to fit their daily-work  needs.  \\nWhen  designing  a web-based  geospatial  platform  there  are several  decisions  to be taken  and \\nthat will briefly covered in this chapter. Note that both the study of the existing platforms  \\n[Error! Reference source not found. as well as the IT user requirements extracted from the  \\nresponses of the questionnaire [ Error! Reference source not found. were considered for the  \\nsolutions  proposed.  \\nAn important characteristic to address is the data storage . As presented in [ Error! Reference  \\nsource not found. rangelands commu nities demand, at least, long time series of several  \\nclimate/biophysical/hazard/socio -economic  datasets  at national/regional  level at high spatial  \\nresolution  and with frequent  updates.  Since  geospatial  data already  require  large  storage  \\ncapability  due to their nature,  the demanding  data catalogue  requested  by the users  \\nexacerbate  this issue.  \\nThere  exist,  however,  different  solutions  to deal with this requirement.  One solution  consists  of \\nhosting  the data on local  machines  so that the owner/developer  of the platform  has complete  \\ncontrol  of the data available  in the catalogue,  therefore  ensuring  rapid  access  to these  data \\nsince  no data queries  are needed  to external  servers.  This solution,  local storage,  presents  some  \\nvery important  drawbacks.  It requires  purchasing,  setting  up and maintaining  servers  with large  \\nstorage  capacities  which  is very pricy.  These  servers  also require  updates  when  the platform  \\nneeds  more  storage  or the hardware  becomes  obsolete.  That will happen  at a certain  point \\nbecause  the steady  increase  of the data at every  data update.  In addition,  the Platform  \\ndevelopers  will have  to manually  upload to the  local servers  the new data produced by  the \\nthird party  collaborators  or the new collections  requested  by the users  so that the data can be \\nduly and timely  available  on the Platform.  Daemons  (computer  program  that runs as a \\nbackground  process)  could be  installed in  the servers  of the data producers  to check  the \\navailability  of new data.  But this is not always  possible  and requires  specific  permissions  that \\nmight  be not granted.  \\nAnother  option  for the data  storage is the use of  a cloud -based  storage . This solution  consists  \\nof renting storage on external servers to host the data requested for the platform. In this  \\napproach  the issues  discussed  for local servers are not  applicable.  The rented  capacity  can be', metadata={'source': '/home/ubuntu/data/2022/1037/BuildingResilienceBigData.pdf', 'page': 15}), Document(page_content='expanded  or reduced  so that it can be adapted  to the needs  of the platform  as it grows.  In \\naddition,  there are already  commercial cloud services  that present geospatial data in their  \\noffer. That is the case of Google Earth Engine, Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services. These  \\ncloud  providers  host in their servers  geospatial  data collections  that are of interest  for \\nrangelands  communities.  Note that data not present  in their catalogues  can be requested  to be \\nadded  or uploaded  following the  approach  described  in the local servers.  \\nIn summary, in order to comply with the requirements regarding the data availability, the  \\nplatform should have great variety of collections at different resolu tions with high periodicity  \\nupdates as well as the possibility to upload data in different formats. Additionally, at least 20  \\nyears  is needed.  All these  reasons  result  in the conclusion  that the optimum  approach  for the \\nplatform relies on the usage of cloud services. Among the possible solutions, Google Earth  \\nEngine  (GEE)  stands  out because  it is currently  the service  with the largest  number  of \\ncollections  incorporated  in its catalogue.  On top of this, most of the success ful and with the \\nmost optimized  performance  geospatial  platforms  employ  GEE as backend,  including  Earth  Map \\nas discussed  with FAO’s  during  our meeting  [Error!  Reference  source  not found. ]. \\nAnother  relevant  topic is the requirement  on the processed  data.  The platform  could  include  \\ndata pre-processed  on its catalogue  and this would  include  time series  statistics,  combined  data \\nor spatial  aggregations.  These  data can be processed  off-line and added  to the catalogue  by the \\nplatform owner  so it can be directly  visualized  and downloaded  by users.  This might  be an \\ninteresting  option  when  a scientific  team  that knows  well the user community  needs  is behind  \\nthe platform  so they can create  and validate  the processed  data relevant  for the users  (e.g. \\n[RD.10] ). Nevertheless,  based  on the questionnaire  responses,  each group  of users  has different  \\nexpectations  on the platform  design.  To be as compliant  as possible  with the user demands  the \\nbest solution is to provide the user with the capability of processing their data via integrated  \\napplications,  toolboxes  or notebooks.  It would  not necessarily  imply  users  having  programming  \\nskills to develop  their own application,  instead  the platform  developers  can install  pre- \\nconfigured  applications  on the platform  giving  the user possibility  to process  what they need  in \\na friendly  interface  for non-scientific  / non-technical  users.  \\nThe processing  algorithms  will run on either  the local servers  or cloud  services.  The advantages  \\nof a cloud  solution  mentioned  in the storage  section  holds  here too: easily  scalable  to the \\ndemand  and discarded  the need  to purchase  and maintain  local machines.  Moreover,  some  \\nservices  that offer cloud  processing,  already  implement  efficiently  some  of the most common  \\nfunctions  for geospatial  data processing  (e.g. layer combinations,  temporal  and spatial  mean)  \\nfurther  increasing  the preference  to implement  these  services  on the platform.  \\nIn conclusion,  a commercial  cloud  processing  solution  stand  out as the best option  according  to \\nthe meetings  held with the platforms’  owners  [Error!  Reference  source  not found. ] and to the \\nrequirements discussed in [ Error! Reference source not found. . A variety of the platforms  \\nanalysed use GEE as their processing tool (e.g. [RD.1] , [RD.8] , [RD.9] and [RD.10] ) which is a  \\nsolution  that implements  many  functionalities  aimed  at geospatial  processing  and solves  the \\nstorage  solution,  therefore  it is the most powerful  option  available  for the Rangelands  Data', metadata={'source': '/home/ubuntu/data/2022/1037/BuildingResilienceBigData.pdf', 'page': 16}), Document(page_content=\"Platform ’s backend.  At the time of writing  the GMV  team  has had contacted  with Rebecca  \\nMoore,  director  of Google  Earth  and Google  Earth  Engine,  to explore  the possibility  of \\npartnering  in this initiative.  \\nTo address  the challenges  posed  by the rangelands  user community  in the visualization  of the \\ndata,  it is required  a frontend  with enough  functionalities  to integrate  all the tools mentioned  in \\nthe data processing  discussion.  Our analysis  revealed that, currently,  the best options  are \\nMapBox  and TerriaJS . MapBox stands out as the best private option and offers highly  \\ncustomizable  map solutions  for geospatial  websites.  It is implemented  as frontend  solution  on \\n[RD.8]  and [RD.10] . On the other  hand,  TerriaJS  is the best open -source  solution,  consisting  on a \\nframework  for web-based  geospatial  catalogue  and it is implemented,  for instance,  on [RD.2]  \\nand [RD.11] .

An extensive  consultation  taken  \\nplace  over the last year by ILRI and GMV  which  has allowed  us to identify  what we believe  to be \\nthe best structure and modality for the Platform. The website is set up, and currently has the  \\nRangelands  Atlas  already  available  on it (highlighting  the support  provided  from the Big Data \\nPlatform).  The very successful launc h of the Rangelands Atlas as a first step towards the  \\nRangelands  Data Platform  highlighted  strong  international  organisation  support  for filling  the \\ngaps in big data (partners  on the Atlas were ILRI, FAO,  IUCN,  WWF,  UNEP  and ILC Rangelands  \\nInitiative),  as well extensive  media  coverage.  \\nAt the same  time, we/ILRI  have been  involved  in a number  of events  where  we have firstly  \\nraised  awareness  on the demand  for big data on rangelands,  and secondly  shared  the plans  to \\nlaunch  the Platform.  The Rangelands  Data Platform  was presented  at an international  meeting  \\nheld as an official  side event  of the launch  of the UN Decade  of Ecosystem  Restoration  on 4th \\nJune 2021 (Presentations being put on CGSpace and recording on YouTube).

Following  this, some  adjustments  may be needed  to ensure  that \\nthe proposed  Platform  best supports  and links with government  platforms  as much  as possible.  \\nIn addition,  at least one brief will be produced  on current  available  data on rangelands  and \\nremaining  gaps.  \\nThe next step will be to finalise  the design  of the Rangelands  Data Platform  and to launch  it. \\nHowever,  for this we want first to ensure  that secure  funding  is available  for the Platform  for at \\nleast 2-3 years  to allow  for further  development,  updating  and maintenance  – there  is no point \\nlaunching  a Platform  that we cannot  keep updated.

It will bring together big data on rangelands, source data including exploring crowd-sourcing and be an interactive platform for producing reports and trends for multiple users including UN Agencies monitoring rangeland and development agencies and actors developing interventions for rangelands, researchers and academics, and ultimately pastoralists themselves.\n",

For five years the \\nPlatform team has been guided by the conviction that data standards, tools, \\nopen science infrastructure, digital partnerships and technical communities \\nof practice, and applied digital innovation can build powerful capabilities for \\naccelerating impact in agricultural research for development. As a result, this \\nreport points to some cumulative results of this efforts and signals some areas \\nwhere Platform investments will continue to grow in other parts of the One \\nCGIAR portfolio. \\nThere is depth and complexity to manage at the intersection of digital \\ntechnologies and agriculture; technical collaboration is essential in research \\nfor development, and the Platform has shown that CGIAR has important roles \\nto play. The Platform built wide awareness around the importance of Open \\nand FAIR data assets and standards as a foundation for digital transformation \\nin agri-food, delivering critical tools to help scientists discover, reuse, and \\ncollaboratively analyze data. It built CGIAR\\u2019s convening power, coalescing public, \\nprivate, and non-profit stakeholders around a technical agenda for digital \\ninnovation in agricultural development. The Platform\\u2019s technical Communities \\nof Practice (CoPs) boast 6,500 members, meeting a growing demand for CGIAR \\nengagement. The Platform sparked cross-boundary collaborations in areas \\nincluding artificial intelligence and risk in agricultural supply chains, inclusivity \\nin digital technologies, leveraging call records to study women\\u2019s economic \\nempowerment, and linking ethical data guidelines to technology standards. In \\ntotal, the Platform\\u2019s annual Conventions have engaged 5,500 attendees and \\nour communications reached several million stakeholders.\\n\\n6\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021In 2021 the Platform oversaw development and final delivery of the CGIAR \\nOpen and FAIR Data Assets Policy  through a consultative process to \\nformalize Open and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable data \\ntowards a mature data science-driven CGIAR. Many of the Platform\\u2019s tools \\n(e.g., FAIRscribe FAIR publishing workflow, the Agronomy Field Information \\nManagement System - AgroFIMS , GARDIAN ) form a suite of tools to help \\nresearchers to easily make, collect, or find FAIR data assets. In 2019 the System \\nManagement Board asked the Platform team to articulate a digital strategy in \\nthe context of the emergent One CGIAR that builds on this foundational work \\nwith CGIAR data and points the way to more unified analytics approaches \\nfor our organization and our sector. The resulting strategic research  was \\ndelivered in 2021, and its recommendations were wholly adopted by external \\nevaluators of the Platform.  This research became an important resource \\ninforming the design of a new cross-cutting Digital Services unit in the \\nemergent One CGIAR structure. \\nSome of these efforts will continue in new guises. The Platform helped \\ncreate the Global Coalition for Digital Food Systems Innovation  linking \\nindustry-shaping public, private, and non-profit organizations committed to \\nresponsible digital innovation. Throughout 2021, a majority of Platform team \\nmembers led Task Teams and Initiative Design Teams, helping mainstream \\ndigital methods, tools, and strategy in the One CGIAR research portfolio. An \\nexternal evaluation  of the Platform showed that over 60% of respondents \\nfound the Platform relevant; its products, analytical tools and activities added \\nvalue to their work and addressed users\\u2019 needs. CGIAR hired its first Global \\nDirector for Digital, who will building teams and the action agenda for building \\non the Platform\\u2019s achievements in support of the CGIAR 2030 Research and \\nInnovation Strategy.\\n\\n7\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\\n1. 1 Highlight Platform Achievements\\nA major focus of the BIG DATA Platform in 2021 was ensuring the continuity of key cross-cutting digital \\ncapabilities that will be important for realizing the vision of the 2030 Research and Innovation Strategy:  \\ndata standards and open science infrastructure, digital partnerships and technical communities of \\npractice, and applied digital innovation can build powerful new capabilities for accelerating impact \\nin agricultural research for development. \\nIn late 2020 and early 2021, the BIG DATA team made foundational contributions to the 2030 Research \\nand Innovation Strategy, which calls for the digital revolution to be \\u2018central to our way of working\\u2019 \\nas an organization.  In addition, Platform-led strategic research on digital trends, digital capabilities \\norganizations must have, and the roles CGIAR must claim in the sector was reviewed and wholly \\nadopted by the Platform\\u2019s evaluators, creating an important and validated resource informing the \\nnew cross-cutting Digital Services unit in the emergent One CGIAR structure. \\nSome of these efforts will continue in new guises. The Platform helped create the Global Coalition \\nfor Digital Food Systems Innovation linking industry- shaping  public, private, and non-profit \\norganizations committed to responsible digital innovation in food systems. The Excellence in \\nAgronomy initiative has adopted GARDIAN  and CGLabs , providing a key vehicle for continuing to \\nbuild more integrated data and analytics for CGIAR research. Several members of the Platform team \\nled or participated in transition Task Teams and Initiative Design Teams, helping mainstream digital KEY  RESULTS\\n\\n8\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021in our research. An external evaluation looking across all program elements of the Platform showed \\nthat more than 60% of respondents found the Platform relevant; its products, analytical tools and \\nactivities added value to their work and addressed users\\u2019 needs. The new Global Director for Digital \\nhas begun to line out actions and teams for building on the work of the Platform to help One CGIAR \\nfully leverage digital capabilities in support of the 2030 Research Strategy to transform food, land, \\nand water systems in a climate crisis. \\n1.2 Platform Progress towards Outputs and Outcomes\\n1.2.1 Overall Platform progress \\nIn 2021 the Platform team continued making contributions to CGIAR\\u2019s digital capabilities, innovations, \\nand partnerships for impact, while the majority of the Platform team was engaged in the design of a \\nnew One CGIAR research portfolio and organization. \\nORGANIZE\\nModule One, ORGANIZE , develops CGIAR culture and capacity to responsibly manage its research \\noutputs, ensure its intellectual assets are open and FAIR, and to realize the value of well-managed \\ndata. These are fundamental cross-cutting capabilities supporting multidisciplinary research \\ncontributing to poverty reduction, nutrition and food security, and improved management of \\nnatural resources. The team continued to develop the GARDIAN ecosystem and related tools and \\nworkflows, offer workshops and webinars , and lead a One CGIAR transition task team related \\nto CGIAR research data. GARDIAN continued to allow researchers to not only find agricultural \\ndata, but also to fulfill its value, working collaboratively and leveraging shared analytical pipelines \\ndeveloped using the CG Labs analytic workbench. Helping researchers generate and use well-\\nmanaged data is progressively building the value of CGIAR data and creating a culture of data \\nstewardship that will accelerate food security research. \\nCONVENE\\nUnder Module Two, CONVENE , the Platform continued to expand and deepen CGIAR \\npartnerships, methods, and standards in digital agriculture. The Platform\\u2019s technical CoPs grew \\nto 6,500 members and continued to develop digital methods and innovations in agricultural \\nresearch for development. Technical collaboration deepened with the Alphabet company X on \\nco-development of high-throughput phenotyping technologies and standards, with the ultimate \\ngoal of transferring these capabilities to mobile phones suitable for deployment in resource-\\nconstrained breeding environments. The Platform was instrumental in bringing together one of \\nthe coalitions for action linked to the UN Food Systems Summit, with industry-shaping partners \\nfrom public, private, and non-profit spheres around the table and deepening their technical \\ncollaboration in the precompetitive space. The Platform continued to tend to and cultivate over \\n70 partners spanning public, private, and non-profit spheres engaging across all aspects of its \\nprogram.\\n\\n9\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021INSPIRE\\nUnder Module Three, INSPIRE , the Inspire Challenge innovation process presented cumulative \\nsynthesis results  from four grant cycles (21 total awards ) and an evaluation  of the Theory of Change \\nof the Challenge regarding how innovation strategy and management can be used to target and foster \\nmore evidence around the uptake of digital innovations in agricultural research for development. \\nProjects awarded in 2020 continued implementation in 2021, but no new projects were awarded in \\n2021 as the Platform wound down. The Challenge was validated by both stakeholders and external \\nevaluators as an impactful and valuable digital innovation grant program and an important value-\\nadd to CGIAR research delivery. \\nAn external evaluation found that a majority of stakeholders--inside and outside of CGIAR--viewed \\nthe Platform offerings as highly relevant to their work, an indication of CGIAR\\u2019s relevance and \\nimportance in the digital agriculture space. \\n1.2.2 Progress by modules\\nThe Platform\\u2019s Organize Module develops CGIAR culture and capacity to responsibly manage its \\nresearch output, ensure its intellectual assets are open and FAIR, and to actualize the value of well-\\nmanaged data. These are fundamental cross-cutting capabilities supporting multidisciplinary \\nresearch contributing to poverty reduction, nutrition and food security, and improved management \\nof natural resources. In addition to continuing to develop and apply the GARDIAN ecosystem and \\nrelated tools and workflows, the team offered an array of workshops and webinars, in addition to \\nleading a One CGIAR transition task team related to CGIAR research data. GARDIAN continued to allow \\nresearchers to not only find agricultural data, but also to fulfill its value by both working collaboratively \\nand leveraging the analytical pipelines developed using the CG Labs analytic workbench. Helping \\nresearchers generate and use well-managed data is progressively building the value of CGIAR data \\nand creating a culture of data stewardship that will accelerate food security research.1ORGANIZE progressModulE\\n          RELEVANCE TO COVID-19 :\\nModule One program activities were able to proceed as planned.  In fact, the COVID-19 crisis put the need for \\navailable, interoperable data into sharp relief as programs continued to have limited access to the field.\\n\\n10\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021Under the \\u201cConvene\\u201d module, the Platform continued to expand and deepen CGIAR \\npartnerships, methods, and standards in digital agriculture. Platform Communities \\nof Practice continued to grow dramatically in 2021, from 5,000 members to over \\n6,500. Despite winding down CoP activities, our seven technical CoPs, with BIG DATA \\ncommunications support, hosted more than 20 capacity building webinars  on topics \\nsuch as: applications of digital innovations  for index-based agricultural insurance \\nproducts and climate change impacts  on crop yields as early as 2030 (presentation of a \\nstudy published in Nature Food ). This year, many of the CoPs explored themes related \\nto ethical and best practices for data management, including using, prototyping a \\nplatform for secure analysis of agricultural data modeled on the public health system \\nOPENSafely , and how CARE  might help realize Indigenous data sovereignty. \\nTechnical collaboration deepened with the Alphabet company X on co-development \\nof high-throughput phenotyping technologies and standards, with the ultimate goal \\nof transferring these capabilities to mobile phones suitable to be deployed in resource-\\nconstrained breeding environments. The Platform was instrumental in bringing \\ntogether one of the coalitions for action linked to the UN Food Systems Summit, with \\nindustry-shaping partners from public, private, and non-profit spheres around the table \\nand deepening their technical collaboration in the precompetitive space. 2CONVENE progressModulE\\n\\n11\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\\ndetailed annex\\nA Global Coalition for Digital Food Systems\\nThe Platform helped create the Global Coalition for Digital Food Systems  Innovation linking industry-\\nshaping public, private, and non-profit organizations committed to responsible digital innovation in \\nfood systems. \\nBuilding on the momentum of the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit (UNFSS) and putting its shared \\nvision into practice, the Innovation Lever Data Digital Working Group agreed to set in motion a Global \\nCoalition of public, private, and non-profit organizations committed to responsible digital innovation \\nin food systems. The Global Coalition will ensure data and digital technologies are used to their fullest \\npotential to drive public good climate, biodiversity, nutrition, and development outcomes through food systems \\ntransformation. \\nThe Why: We believe data and digital innovations are fundamental to transforming the food system into a \\nfuture state that is universally accessible, sustainable, and resilient. The global food system intersects with multiple \\nchallenges facing humanity including climate change, environmental degradation, biodiversity loss, nutritional \\ninsecurity, and social inequities. To address these challenges effectively, we believe that we must overcome \\nfragmentation within and across sectors to act in a transdisciplinary fashion, bringing together the natural and social \\nsciences with data and technology to drive food systems towards more favorable potential futures for humanity and \\nthe planet. It is a matter of urgency. \\nThe How: We agree to the following principles for data and digital innovation in the service of food systems \\ntransformation. \\n\\u2022 Build an inclusive digital revolution:  We recognize inequities in access and use of data and digital \\ninnovations and we strive to understand and design for human needs in order to foster solutions and \\npartnerships that reflect the diversity and complexity of food systems.\\n\\u2022 Foster data agency and responsible sharing:  We support the agency of data owners to share data, \\nat all levels across the system while supporting the responsible use of data to unlock broader insights and \\ndrive accountability to sustainability goals. \\n\\u2022 Be force multipliers: We seek to collaborate across sectors, disciplines, and alliances, supporting a \\ndiversity of data and digital solutions to address the needs of the many food systems in the world. \\n\\u2022 Iterate and share learnings: We are biased towards action; we share data, evidence, and knowledge as \\nwe iterate to come to the best solutions. \\n\\u2022 Innovate responsibly: We are stewards of data and technologies that may impact billions of people. We \\ncommit and recommit regularly to ethical action, agile governance, and collaborative learning. \\nPartners:  Mercy Corps, Consumers International, World Bank, FAO, CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture, \\nJohn Hopkins University, Google, World Economic Forum, the 50x2030 initiative, GEOGLAM, X Moonshot factory, \\nDigital Green, the Kenya Agricultural Transformation Office, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Pinduoduo, and AI4AI.\\n\\n12\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021detailed annex\\nCollaboration with the GENDER Platform\\nThe Platform team continued to support CGIAR and GENDER efforts to make gender data more \\ndiscoverable and interoperable, and necessary capability for conducting multidisciplinary research \\nand the intersection of gender and food, land, and water systems. \\nCollaborative research with the GENDER Platform built on interesting research results using \\nanonymized call detail records (or \\u201cCDRs\\u201d--many billions of data points generated by the operation \\nof mobile phone networks) to examine some widely accepted indicators for women\\u2019s economic \\nempowerment in agriculture to explore these at a national scale in Uganda in a matter of a few weeks. \\nThis research, done in collaboration with the Gender Platform, resulted in a new research collaboration \\nfurther developing CDR-based methods for gender research that launched in 2021. This research aims to use CDRs \\nto examine how gender and labor dynamics flow in food systems at a national scale in Ghana. \\nUnder Module Three, results and reporting from the Inspire Challenge demonstrated some progress with ensuring \\nwomen\\u2019s\\u2019 participation in projects and laying bare assumptions about how digital interventions affect gender. \\nRelevance to Covid-19:\\nN/A\\n\\n13\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021The Inspire Challenge innovation process presented cumulative synthesis results  from four \\ngrant cycles (21 total awards ) and an evaluation of the Theory of Change of the Challenge \\nregarding how innovation strategy and management can be used to target and foster more \\nevidence around and uptake of digital innovations in agricultural research for development. \\nProjects awarded in 2020 continued implementation throughout 2021, but no new projects \\nwere awarded in 2021 as the Platform wound down. 3 INSPIRE progressModulE\\nIn 2021, the Platform continued support for a portfolio of 21 innovative projects using big data approaches to \\nadvance agricultural research and development. In total, these projects include collaborations between a total of \\nnine CGIAR Centers and Research Programs and 22 diverse external partners, including start-ups, governmental \\nagencies, universities, and private sector businesses.\\nImportant results from Inspire Challenge projects achieved in 2021 include:\\nPlantVillage Nuru , an award-winning AI-informed approach to pest and disease monitoring, was granted \\nUS$500,000 in November 2021 to continue providing hyper-local, AI-driven advice to millions \\nof farmers, but also to begin new efforts in tree planting, drought-tolerant crop planting, and \\nconservation agriculture.

The Platform has a whole has continued to contribute to One \\nCGIAR design and digital strategy. \\n1.2.4 Altmetric and Publication highlights\\nThe Platform outcomes are focused on organizational change and strategy rather than scientific \\npublications. \\nThe six peer-reviewed publications generated by the Platform are reported under their specific \\nprojects. In addition, a publication  led by the Platform Management unit has garnered the most \\nnotable attention via Altmetric (95th percentile) as well as 16 media mentions to date: Nature Machine \\nIntelligence. \\u201cResponsible artificial intelligence in agriculture requires systemic understanding of \\nrisks and externalities\\u201d.\\nThe Platform communications reach and engagement continued to grow throughout 2021. Some \\nkey milestones include: \\nThe Platform website surpassed 200,000 visits a year from 65,000 unique users; \\nThe communications team continued to promote Platform-supported publications, CoP work, \\nand partnership projects to our audience that grew to nearly 40,000 across all channels;\\nOur newsletter reached 6,000 subscribers with our regular updates, achieving above average \\nindustry rates of engagement; and \\nThe Platform has published more than 230 newsletters and hosted more than 100 webinars.\\nThe reach and growth of our annual convention, CoPs, and communications would not be possible \\nwithout high demand for CGIAR domain expertise in the wider digital agriculture community.\\n\\n16\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 20211.3 Cross-cutting dimensions (at Platform level)\\n1.3.1 Gender\\nA) List any important PTF research findings\\nUnder Module One, the Platform team continued to support CGIAR and Gender Platform efforts to \\nmake gender data more discoverable and interoperable, and necessary capability for conducting \\nmultidisciplinary research and the intersection of gender and food, land, and water systems.\\nUnder Module Two we built on interesting research results using anonymized call detail records \\n(or \\u201cCDRs\\u201d--many billions of data points generated by the operation of mobile phone networks) \\nto examine some widely accepted indicators for women\\u2019s economic empowerment in agriculture \\nto explore these at a national scale in Uganda in a matter of a few weeks. This research, done in \\ncollaboration with the Gender Platform, resulted in a new research collaboration further developing \\nCDR-based methods for gender research that launched in 2021. This research aims to use CDRs to \\nexamine how gender and labor dynamics flow in food systems at a national scale in Ghana.\\nUnder Module Three, results and reporting from the Inspire Challenge demonstrated progress with \\nensuring women\\u2019s participation in projects and laying bare some assumptions about how digital \\ninterventions affect gender. \\nB) What have you learned? What are you doing differently?\\nIn addition to building on promising methods and support to the organization to make gender data \\nmore discoverable, the team (and its evaluators) found that more work is to be done on establishing \\nan ME framework for examining how gender and digital innovations interact in and around digital \\ninnovation grants in agri-food. \\nC) Have any problems arisen in relation to gender issues or integrating gender into the PTF\\u2019s \\nresearch?\\nThe Platform is not a research program, though we have ventured into research where we saw that \\ndigital methods development or helping develop a new digital capability could be an important \\nsupport to research.\\n1.3.2 Youth and other aspects of Social inclusion / \\u201cLeaving No-one Behind\\u201d\\nUnder Module One, the Platform team continued to support CGIAR and Gender Platform efforts \\nto make demographic data more discoverable and interoperable, and necessary capability for \\nconducting multidisciplinary research and the intersection of social inclusion and food, land, and \\nwater systems. \\nUnder Module Two, in 2021 the Platform sought to keep its Youth in Data network active amid a fluid \\norganizational and operational context, seeking to find its new \\u2018home\\u2019 under One CGIAR. \\nUnder Module Three, all Inspire Challenge projects were required to be explicit about their \\nassumptions and planned actions regarding social inclusion, including youth, women, and potentially \\nmarginalized groups.\\n\\n17\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021A) List any important PTF research findings\\nPlatforms are generally not involved in research; they have an organizational development role. That \\nsaid, we found that involving youth in reporting on data science and digital agriculture strengthened \\nonline engagement and built new digital connections across digital agriculture startups in East Africa \\nand India (the two places where the Youth in Data initiative was leveraged in support of the BIG DATA \\nConvention). This is reported in more detail under Module Two. \\nB) What have you learned? What are you doing differently?\\nOne key learning of 2021 is that our Youth in Data initiative, which incorporated annual workshops \\n(reaching 150 youth from almost 50 countries in 2020 alone), should likely be repurposed as a \\ntechnical community of practice at the intersection of youth and digital agriculture. The Platform \\nteam is advocating that such technical communities of practice have a formal role in contributing to \\ndigital governance under One CGIAR. \\nC) Have any problems arisen in relation to youth issues or integrating youth into the PTF\\u2019s \\nresearch?\\nOrganizational fluidity amid closeout of one portfolio and the staged rollout of the next portfolio \\nhave made it challenging to find an enduring organizational \\u2018home\\u2019 for the Platform\\u2019s social inclusion \\nefforts related to digital agriculture. \\n1.3.3 Capacity Development\\nUnder Module One, the Platform addressed capacity development from a number of different angles \\nin 2021, including approaches having to do with incentivizing and providing researchers with clarity \\nregarding expectations around data asset management (via the development of the Open and FAIR \\nData Assets Policy); value demonstration via high-impact data science and ML research drawing \\non CGIAR data in GARDIAN and resulting publications (e.g., Nature Food and Nature Machine \\nIntelligence); and more traditional capacity development activities including user workshops and \\ndemos and webinars.\\nUnder Model Two, the Platform Communities of Practice continued to organize community-wide \\nactivities, standards development, and virtual events designed to strengthen the technical capacity \\nof the community of practitioners inside and outside of the organization. The Module also coordinated \\nthe provision and management of Shared Services across Centers, especially Esri\\u2019s suite of GIS tools, \\nOpen Data Kit (ODK), and Coursera Data Science Academy.\\nUnder Module Three, the Inspire Challenge fosters partnerships to leverage capabilities that CGIAR \\ndoes not have in-house, building experience and digital capabilities for research delivery. In 2021, \\n17 projects spanning the 2019 and 2020 cohorts collaborated with 34 external partners bringing an \\narray of capabilities across CGIAR and partner organizational boundaries, capabilities as diverse as: \\nbig-data analysis for aquaculture pathogens to enable their detection using nanopore sequencing \\ndevices in-field, integrating data from the operation of cell tower networks into localizing digital \\nfinancial services for farmers and small agri-food businesses, and leverage computer vision and \\ndatabases to predict coffee yields. The Platform team sees this as an important \\u201clearn by doing\\u201d \\napproach to developing capacity of both CGIAR and partner teams.\\n\\n18\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 20211.3.4 Climate Change\\nUnder Module One, the Platform supported greater and faster innovation related to climate change \\nby continuing to build awareness and compliance around Open and FAIR data assets, and value \\ndemonstrations via high-impact data science and ML research drawing on CGIAR data in GARDIAN \\nand resulting publications (e.g., Nature Food and Nature Machine Intelligence). Traditional capacity \\ndevelopment activities including user workshops and demos and webinars also showcased the value \\nof well-managed, Open and FAIR data assets in enabling climate research in agile and transparent \\nways.\\nUnder Module Two the Platform Communities of Practice continued to develop standards, data \\nsets, models for guiding climate adaptation, and services to equip CGIAR researchers and an array of \\npartners to conduct the necessary analytics to mitigate climate change. \\nSeveral awardees of Inspire Challenge grants under Module Three focused on building the dynamic \\nand responsive intelligence needed for food and farming systems to navigate increasing weather \\nvariability, in areas as varied as digitally enabled advisory services, an information system for resilient \\nrangelands, gamification of weather forecasting, and more.\\n\\n19\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\\nEFFECTIVENESS  \\nAND EFFICIENCY\\n2. 1 Management and governance\\nNo changes to overall Platform governance and management were made in 2021. The Platform \\ncontinued to leverage three active governance bodies: the Management Team, which consisted of \\nleaders from the technical CoPs and members of the Secretariat; the Steering Committee, which \\nincluded representatives of CGIAR Centers and Programs, as well as and external experts from the \\nprivate sector, funding organizations, and research; and an entirely external international advisory \\nboard. \\n2.2 Partnerships \\n2.2.1. Highlights of External Partnerships\\nThe Platform continued to expand and deepen external partnerships in support of building a more \\ndigital CGIAR. Several members served on design teams for the new CGIAR research portfolio, helping \\ndrive wide-ranging external consultations with public, public, private and non-profit stakeholders on \\nhow to leverage data and digital tools to drive impact through our research. The Platform advanced \\ntechnical collaboration and partnerships with big data firms, adding important capabilities to our\\n\\n20\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021community related to developing computer vision technologies for remote sensing and on-the-\\nground high throughput phenotyping, supercomputing, and development of new digital research \\ntools and methods. One key vehicle for further developing these partnerships was the UN Food \\nSystems Summit, where the Platform participated in the Innovation Lever and helped assemble a \\nnew public/private/non-profit digital coalition for sourcing, fostering, and scaling digital agri-food \\ninnovations. \\n2.2.2. Cross-CGIAR Partnerships\\nThe Platform team led two Transition Task Teams in preparation for the digital transition to the One \\nCGIAR research portfolio: one on data strategy, standards, and infrastructure; and transitional digital \\ncapabilities for research. All One CGIAR centers participated in these teams.\\n2.3. Intellectual Assets\\nHave any intellectual assets been strategically managed by the PTF (together with the relevant \\nCenter) this year? \\nThe Platform has negotiated partnerships with digital firms to co-develop imaging technologies for \\nphenotyping with CGIAR while generating data as a public good for breeding, plant pathology, and \\nincreasingly agronomic use-cases.\\nIndicate any published patents and/or plant variety right applications (or equivalent)\\nN/A\\nList any critical issues or challenges encountered in the management of intellectual assets\\nN/A\\n2.4 Monitoring, Evaluation, Impact Assessment and Learning (MELIA)\\nThe Platform participated in several Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning actions related to data \\nand digitally-enabling agricultural research for development in 2021. These actions targeted various \\nlevels including both the CGIAR organization as a whole and the BIG DATA Platform as a program, \\nand specific BIG DATA modules or programmatic elements, and within the context of specific BIG \\nDATA innovation grants. The Platform led strategic research informing the content and structure \\nof the new Digital Services unit under One CGIAR, underwent an external evaluation that found \\nPlatform offerings were relevant to an array of stakeholders, and commissioned an evaluation of the \\nInspire Challenge to examine how CGIAR can serve as an effective \\u201cbridging institution\\u201d for sourcing, \\nfostering, and scaling digital agri-food innovation.\\n\\n21\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 20212.5 Efficiency\\nThe Platform\\u2019s Communities of Practice began to grow dramatically once a few key metrics \\nwere implemented related to the number of collaborative products and communications they \\ngenerated, in the context of a collaborative and validated annual workplan. Communities of Practice \\nare notoriously difficult to build and maintain, but the BIG DATA communities continued to grow \\nthroughout 2021, from 5,000 members to over 6,500. Under Module One the GARDIAN ecosystem \\nwas linked more directly to a new initiative under One CGIAR, and this accelerated progress towards \\nanchoring it in more specific user needs. These are important learnings related to harnessing the \\nbreadth and depth of CGIAR domain expertise and making the digital revolution central to our way \\nof working.\\n2.6 Management of Risks to Your Platform\\nThe Platform for BIG DATA continued to operate in a fluid context characterized by significant \\norganizational change and some continued disruption from the COVID-19 crisis. To manage \\noperational risks, some exceptional no-cost extensions were granted to projects needing a few extra \\nmonths to deliver. To navigate organizational change, the Platform team participated actively in \\ndesign groups for One CGIAR, spanning a majority of research initiatives and providing input to the \\nnew Digital Services design and establishment.\\n2.7 Use of W1-2 Funding\\nThe final year of the Platform was also a year of intensive design of the new One CGIAR research \\nportfolio as well as intensive transition planning. The Platform team led One CGIAR Transition Task \\nTeams related to data and transitional capabilities for research while contributing to the design of \\nseveral new research initiatives. The UN Food Systems Summit provided an important vehicle for \\ncoalescing public, private, and non-profit stakeholders around sourcing, fostering, and scaling digital \\nagri-food innovations, and the Platform was instrumental in the formation of the UN FSS- linked \\n\\u201cGlobal Coalition for Digital Food Systems Innovation.\\u201d\\n\\n22\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\\nN/A\\n\\n23\\nCGIAR PLATFORM FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\\nlist of tables\\nTable 2:  Condensed list of policy contributions in this reporting year  \\n (Sphere of Influence) 24\\nTable 3:  List of Outcome/Impact Case Reports from this reporting year  \\n (Sphere of Influence) 25\\nTable 4:  Condensed list of innovations by stage for this reporting year 26\\nTable 5: Summary of status of Planned Outcomes and Milestones  \\n (Sphere of Influence-Control) 27\\nTable 6: Numbers of peer-reviewed publications from current reporting period 40\\nTable 7: Participants in CapDev Activities 40\\nTable 8: Key external partnerships 41\\nTable 9: Internal Cross-CGIAR Collaborations 42\\nTable 10: Monitoring, Evaluation, Learning and Impact Assessment (MELIA) 43\\nTable 11: Update on Actions Taken in Response to Relevant Evaluations 45\\nTable 13: Platform Financial Report 46\\nTable Annexes 47\\n\\nTitle of policy, \\nlegal instrument, \\ninvestment or \\ncurriculum to which \\nCGIAR contributedDescription of policy, legal \\ninstrument, investment or \\ncurriculum to which CGIAR \\ncontributedLevel of \\nMaturityLink to sub-IDOsCGIAR cross-cutting marker score\\nLink to OICR\\nGender Youth CapDevClimate \\nChange\\n632 - Near Real-Time \\nData in Support of \\nNational Fisheries \\nStrategy in Timor LesteThe PeskAAS system was \\nused to provide data for \\ndrafting of the new fisheries \\nstrategy and law, and is now \\nintegrated into fisheries \\nmanagement decision-\\nmaking.Stage 2 yEnhanced institutional \\ncapacity of partner research \\norganizations\\n yEnhanced conservation of \\nhabitats and resources1 - \\nSignificant1 - \\nSignificant2 - \\nPrincipal1 - \\nSignificantOICR3874\\n795 - CGIAR Open and \\nFAIR Data Assets PolicyThe CGIAR Open and Fair \\nData Assets Policy clarifies \\nexpectations regarding \\nthe management and \\ndissemination of data assets \\nto ensure they are as open as \\npossible, FAIR, and managed \\nresponsibly.Stage 1 yEnhanced institutional \\ncapacity of partner research \\norganizations\\n yIncreased capacity for \\ninnovations in partner \\nresearch organizations? - Too \\nearly to tell? - Too \\nearly to tell2 - \\nPrincipal1 - \\nSignificantThe OFDA Policy \\nwas drafted by \\nCABI and revised \\nand delivered \\nby the Big Data \\nPlatform.

The Global \\nCoalition will ensure data and digital technologies are used to their fullest potential to drive public good climate, biodiversity, nutrition, and development \\noutcomes through food systems transformation. \\nThe Why:  We believe data and digital innovations are fundamental to transforming the food system into a future state that is universally accessible, \\nsustainable, and resilient. The global food system intersects with multiple challenges facing humanity including climate change, environmental degradation, \\nbiodiversity loss, nutritional insecurity, and social inequities. To address these challenges effectively, we believe that we must overcome fragmentation within \\nand across sectors to act in a transdisciplinary fashion, bringing together the natural and social sciences with data and technology to drive food systems \\ntowards more favorable potential futures for humanity and the planet. It is a matter of urgency.  \\nThe How: We agree to the following principles for data and digital innovation in the service of food systems transformation.  \\n\\u2022 Build an inclusive digital revolution:  We recognize inequities in access and use of data and digital innovations, and we strive to understand and \\ndesign for human needs, fostering solutions and partnerships that reflect the diversity and complexity of food systems.\\n\\u2022 Foster data agency and responsible sharing:  We support the agency of data owners to share data, at all levels across the system while supporting \\nthe responsible use of data to unlock broader insights and drive accountability to sustainability goals. \\n\\u2022 Be force multipliers: We seek to collaborate across sectors, disciplines, and alliances, supporting a diversity of data and digital solutions to address \\nthe needs of the many food systems in the world. \\n\\u2022 Iterate and share learnings: We are biased towards action; we share data, evidence, and knowledge as we iterate to come to the best solutions. \\n\\u2022 Innovate responsibly: We are stewards of data and technologies that may impact billions of people. We commit and recommit regularly to ethical \\naction, agile governance, and collaborative learning. \\nPartners:\\nMercy Corps, Consumers International, World Bank, FAO, CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture, John Hopkins University, Google, World Economic \\nForum, the 50x2030 initiative, GEOGLAM, X Moonshot factory, Digital Green, the Kenya Agricultural Transformation Office, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, \\nPinduoduo, and AI4AI.\\nCollaboration with the GENDER Platform\\nThe Platform team continued to support CGIAR and GENDER efforts to make gender data more discoverable and interoperable, and necessary capability for \\nconducting multidisciplinary research and the intersection of gender and food, land, and water systems.\\n\\nFP Detailed Annex\\nM2: Convene Collaborative research with the GENDER Platform built on interesting research results using anonymized call detail records (or \\u201cCDRs\\u201d--many billions of \\ndata points generated by the operation of mobile phone networks) to examine some widely accepted indicators for women\\u2019s economic empowerment in \\nagriculture to explore these at a national scale in Uganda in a matter of a few weeks. This research, done in collaboration with the Gender Platform, resulted in \\na new research collaboration further developing CDR-based methods for gender research that launched in 2021. This research aims to use CDRs to examine \\nhow gender and labor dynamics flow in food systems at a national scale in Ghana. \\nUnder Module Three, results and reporting from the Inspire Challenge demonstrated some progress with ensuring women\\u2019s\\u2019 participation in projects and \\nlaying bare assumptions about how digital interventions affect gender.  \\nM3: Inspire In 2021, the Platform continued support for a portfolio of 21 innovative projects using big data approaches to advance agricultural research and development. \\nIn total, these projects include collaborations between a total of nine CGIAR Centers and Research Programs and 22 diverse external partners, including start-\\nups, governmental agencies, universities, and private sector businesses.\\nImportant results from Inspire Challenge projects achieved in 2021 include:\\nPlantVillage Nuru , an award-winning AI-informed approach to pest and disease monitoring, was granted US$500,000 in November 2021 to continue \\nproviding hyper-local, AI-driven advice to millions of farmers, but also to begin new efforts in tree planting, drought-tolerant crop planting, and conservation \\nagriculture. Other gifts will be matched 1:1 up to a total of US$2 million over the next two years. The project was also awarded US$100,000 by XPRIZE for \\nenabling carbon removal.

This has led to poorly  planned  \\ninvestments,  particularly  in pastoralist  areas  which,  in many  cases,  has damaged  rather  than \\nstrengthened  the resilience  of communities.  \\nThe project  Building  Resilience  in Rangeland  Communities  with Big Data, led by ILRI and \\ntechnologically  supported  by GMV,  was selected  as a pilot project  winner  in the CGIAR\\u2019s  Inspire  \\nChallenge  2020  and provided  with an award  of US$100,000.  This project  planned  to establish  \\nthe first-ever online  global  Rangelands  Data Platform,  agreed upon by  global actors,  for \\nmonitoring  rangelands  and consolidating  rangeland  data,  including  ecosystem  health,  change,  \\nrisks,  and restoration  opportunities.  It is anticipated  that this Rangelands  Data Platform  will \\nserve  as the \\u201cgo-to\\u201d information  source  on rangelands,  with data made  publically  available.  The \\ninformation  on land use change  and restoration  will be particularly  important  for guiding  global  \\nand national  investments  in rangelands  better  building  the resilience  of communities  to shocks  \\nand stresses,  and for global  and advocacy  work related  to this. Such  global  data are vital for use \\nin global processes and initiatives such as the UN D ecade on Ecosystem Restoration , the \\nanticipated International Year  of Rangelands  and Pastoralists  as well as for development  \\nagencies  such as IFAD  and advocacy  networks  such as Livestock  Data for Decisions  (LD4D).  \\nThe primary  and end beneficiaries  of this project  are pastoralists  and agro-pastoralists  who will \\nbenefit from more informed, better planned and better value -for-money investments in  \\nrangelands.  It is also anticipated  that eventually  pastoralists  and other  rangeland  users  will \\nbenefit  from and use the data itself,  though  how to best present  the data for such use needs  to \\nbe further  developed.  National  governments,  national  research  centres  and local pastoralist  \\nnetworks  are also key partners.  \\nIn the early  months  of the project,  concerns  were  raised  by those  involved  in the project  about  \\nsetting up a Platform without confirmed funds for upkeep and maintenance of that Platform,  \\nwhich  is not yet the case. As such, we  decided  to go as far as possible with  developing  the \\n \\n1 www.rangelandsdata.org/atlas\\n\\nstructure and content of the Platform without actually setting it up on line though a domain  \\nand website  would  be created,  and part developed  for a Rangelands  Atlas.  This aim was to do \\nthis in the most  inclusive  and informative  way working  with different  stakeholders  so all would  \\nbe aware  of the impending  Platform  and be able to contribute  to its development.  At the same  \\ntime effort would be invested in identifying and securing funds for long -term support to the  \\nPlatform  (discussed  more  in Section  6.0). \\n \\n \\n1.2 This report  \\nThis report  summarises  the activities  that have taken  place  as part of the project  Building  \\nResilience  in Rangeland  Communities  with Big Data from January -December  2021.  Each  \\nsection will  describe  a step in the process  towards  developing  the anticipated  global  \\nRangelands  Data Platform.  The final section  will give the current  status  of the Platform,  \\ntogether  with challenges  incurred,  and future  plans  for further  development  of the Platform.\\n\\n2.0 ANALYSIS  OF EXISTING  GEOSPATIAL  PLATFORMS  \\nThe first step in establishing  the Rangelands  Data Platform  was a review  of existing  geospatial  \\nplatforms  with potentially  similar  objectives  to those  of the Rangelands  Data Platform.  This has \\nhelped  to consider  whether  any of these  would  be suitable  for hosting  the Rangelands  Data \\nPlatform; to identify best current technologies for the development of the Platform; and to  \\nselect the most interesting from which to learn. Meetings have been held with the owners of  \\nsome  of these  to learn  more  about  their architecture  and understand  the decisions  they made  \\nwhen  building  their platforms.  \\nThe list of  platforms  and applications  was initiated by  ILRI and  associated partners  and \\ncomplemented  by GMV  with few more  platforms  relevant  for the study.  A brief summary  of \\nthe results  of the analysis  is presented  in the table below.

The most relevant  \\nplatforms  for the design  of a Rangelands  Data Platform  were identified.  ILRI and GMV  \\ncontacted  the owners/developers  of the most  interesting  platforms  to better  understand  the IT \\narchitecture and further understand the motivations behind the critical decisions in their  \\ndesign. The two fruitful meetings held with FAO and GEOGLAM are here below briefly  \\ndescribed.  \\nThe meeting  with FAO was  with Danilo  Mollicone,  Alfon so Sanchez -Paus Diaz and  Daniel  \\nDionisio,  leads  of the FAO\\u2019s  Earth  Map platform  [RD.1]  developed within  FAO's  Open Foris  \\nInitiative.  In this meeting  ILRI and GMV  learned  about  the technologies  used in the platform  \\nbackend  (Google  Earth  Engine)  and got to know  more  in depth  how their platform  integrates  \\nwith Google technologies. Considering that CGIAR and FAO have on -going agreements, FAO  \\noffered  to potentially  deploy  the frontend  of the future  Rangelands  Data Platform  under  their \\nexisting  environment.  This option  has great  advantages  (in cost and effort)  but also important  \\nlimitations  with respect  to the customization  of the platform  that should  be further  analysed.  \\nEarth  Map is open -source  and will be uploaded  to GitHub,  so it could  be also possible  to \\ndevelop the  rangelands  data platform  using  FAO\\u2019s  developments  as baseline  upon  getting  \\nsuccessful  agreement  between  CGIAR/ILRI  and Google  to get their in-kind support  under  their \\nGoogle  Cloud  for Researchers  program.  \\nThe second  meeting  was held with Juan Guerschman  (RAPP  project  leader  from CSIRO)  and Ian \\nJarvis  (Program  Director  of the GEOGLAM  initiative),  about the  RAPP  Map platform  [RD.2]  \\nunder GEOGLAM. GMV and ILRI learned more about RAPP\\u2019s architecture and the tools and  \\ntechnologies  in use. The open -source  tool Terria.js  stands  out as a possible  solution  for the \\nRangelands Data Platform\\u2019s frontend. RAPP\\u2019s data catalogue is supported by in -kind \\ncollaborations  with several  large  research  institutions.  That means  that to replicate  the \\napproach  in rangelands  data platform  we would  need  to develop  our own solutions  in terms  of \\ndata storage and data access. GEOGLAM welcome the possibility to include the Rangelands  \\nData  platform  as an associate.\\n\\n3.0 RANGELANDS  ATLAS  \\n3.1 Development  and launch  of a Rangelands  Atlas \\n \\nA key input to the development  of the Rangelands  Data Platform  has been  the production  of \\nsets of maps on  rangelands,  combining  a rangelands basemap made up  of rangeland -type \\nterrestrial  ecoregions  drawn  from WWF\\u2019s  categorisation  of these  at global  level with other  \\npublically  available  large  data sets on different  themes/issues  including  global  protected  areas,  \\nkey biodiversity  areas,  land degradation  neutrality  indicators,  climate  change  modelling  and \\nother.  See: https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome -categories/terrestrial -ecoregions  \\nThese  maps  and the data developed  from the mapping  process  were compiled  in the first-ever \\nglobal  Rangelands  Atlas  together  with local case studies  and facts and figures  drawn  from the \\ndata.  This Atlas  was launched  in May, in the week  leading  up to the launch  of the UN Decade  of \\nEcosystem Restoration. The Atlas was presented as a collaboration between ILRI, FAO, IUCN,  \\nWWF,  UNEP  and the ILC Rangelands  Initiative,  as well as the Livestock  and PIM CRPs,  and the \\nBig Data Platform  and contributing to  the UN Decade  of Ecosystem  Restoration.  \\nThe Atlas  is also on line, as a project  of the global  Rangelands  Data Platform.  In order  to set this \\nup the web domains have been purchased and are ready for use for the Rangelands Data  \\nPlatform, with the domain address: www.rangelandsdata.org . The address  \\nwww.datarangelands.org  was also purchased  so that no-one else will be able to use this very \\nsimilar  address.  The address  of the Atlas  is www.rangelandsdata.org/atlas  \\nThe launch  received  significant  publicity,  with the Atlas  presented  several  times  at different  \\nevents  in June including  as part of the official  programme  of the UN Decade  (see below).  Maps  \\nand data will continue  to be added  and the website  developed  as we move  towards  developing  \\nthe data platform  itself.  A list of some  of the significant  publicity  received  by the launch  of the \\nAtlas is provided in Appendix 1.  The Atlas was announced on the Big Data Platform:  \\nhttps://bigdata.cgiar.org/inspire/inspire -challe nge-2020/big -data-in-resilience -of-rangeland - \\ncommunities/  \\nhttps://bigdata.cgiar.org/blog - \\npost/%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B  \\nnew-atlas-reveals -climate -critical -rangelands -cover -half-the-worlds -land-surface -supporting - \\nmillions -of-people -and-critical -ecosystems/\\n\\n4.0 SURVEY  TO GATHER  INFORMATION  ON USER  REQUIREMENTS  \\n \\nAs part of the process  of getting  stakeholder  input into the design  of the Rangelands  Data \\nPlatform  an online  survey  was undertaken.  \\n \\n4.1 Results  of the survey  \\nThe questionnaire  \\u201cRequirements  gathering  for Rangelands  Data Platform \\u201d was disseminated  in \\nEnglish,  French  and Spanish  through  several  networks  to receive  user feedback  and develop  the \\nmost  useful  data platform  for the rangelands  community.  We requested  to the potential  user of \\nthis platform to answer a short 14 -question survey on what they would like from such a  \\nplatform. Few more optional technical questions were also provided in addition to better  \\ndefine  the IT design  of the platform.  \\nThe networks  contacted  include  the AfriCul tuReS  community,  the Grassland  Dialogue  Platform,  \\nIFAD  GeoGroup,  IFAD  country  directors,  FAO EarthMap  developers,  GEOGLAM  RAPP  \\ndevelopers,  the FAO Pastoralist  Knowledge  Hub and FAO,  ESA and IFAD  staff directly  involved  in \\nrangelands  management.  The questionnaire  and the summary  of responses  is provided  in \\nAnnex  2. The responses  tailored by  the most represented  user groups are also  provided  as \\nreference  Annex  3. \\nThe survey  received  77 responses  (by 10th November  2021).  40% of the responses  came from  \\nacademia.  Government  bodies,  NGOs  and international  agencies  cover  almost  equally  other  \\n30% of the total responses.  \\nThe questionnaire  offered  a long list of services  that could  be available  in the future  platform.  \\nThe greatest  interest  was on having  global  datasets  to assess  the current  status  and trends  in \\nrangelands . In particular, data to monitor environmental trends and land use dynamics in  \\nrangelands  were the most demanded.  According  to the statistics  the information  about  trends  \\nin livestock numbers is also very relevant for the respondents. 70 -80% of the responses to the  \\nsurvey  cover  those  topics.  \\nWorth  noting  that 60% of the respondents  are also interested  in a repository  of information  \\nabout  rangelands,  and in having  the possibility  to self-process  data and maps . \\nIt is remarkable  that all the options  receive  support  from at least 35% of the participants.  \\nTogether  with the already  mentioned, highest preferences  for governmental employees also  \\ninclude verification of national datasets and data for improvement reporting for \\ninternational/national  commitments.  NGOs  find also of interest  advocacy  and lobbying , and \\ncrowd -sourcing  of data. \\nThese  needs  are reinforced  by the answers  given  by the participants  to the question  on their \\nwillingness  to use certain  datasets  from a list of pre-selected  ones.  90% of the participants  \\nrespond  that they would  use information  on livestock  distribution  and routes , and land use\\n\\nland cover  (LULC)  current  status  and trends . Data on climate  projections  were also of interest  \\nfor near 65% of respondents.  Worth  noting  that soil erosion  is of great  interest  for \\ngovernments  and conflicts  relevant  for NGOs  and international  agencies.  \\nAll responses  were selected  by, at least,  20% of the participants.  \\nPotential  users  demand  data and information  to be available  in the platform  at country  level . \\nInformation at  regional  administrative boundaries in -country  and across country  are also \\nrelevant  for more  than half of the participants.  \\nRegarding  the question  about  the highest  interest  questions  to be answered  for understanding  \\nrangelands, many respondents mentioned changes in land use in rangelands, analysing  \\ndegradation  in rangelands  due to overgrazing  and climate , how climate change is impacting  \\nrangelands and livestock, information about livestock population and carrying capa city, and  \\nwhere  the rangelands  are. \\nAbout  the trends  to follow,  again  dynamics  of livestock  and land use are the most repeated  \\nanswers. Worth also mentioning climate change impacts and trends of vegetation cover,  \\nrangelands  degradation,  demography and  biomass . \\nOn the data to be provided  by the platform,  there  are many  different  requests  for very different  \\npurposes. The key words are: trends, change, livestock, regular updates, land use, soil,  \\ndegradation,  rehabilitation,  maps.  That might  be synthetized  in a platform  hosting  geospatial  \\ndata (maps)  to analyse  trends,  changes  and degradation  on livestock,  land use and soil with \\nregular updates  for rehabilitation  purposes. However,  note that many  other  applications  are \\nrequested. Flexibility is a must in the platform in order to respond to the needs and  \\nexpectations  from the different  rangelands  communities.  \\nThe most mentioned  uses for the data and services  requested  in the previous  questions  are for \\npolicy  development,  research,  impact  analysis,  education,  investment  planning  and advocacy.  \\nThe question  regarding  the data to be collected  at national  level to consolidate  global  products  \\nfollows  the previous  responses.  Trends  on LULC,  livestock  and land degradation . Land  \\nproductivity,  biomass  and vegetation  cover  have also relevance  in the answers.  \\nHalf of the participants  would  have interest  in uploading  local  data to the platform.  That \\nincludes photos,  reports  and national  datasets in  tabular,  raster  or vector  data. \\nMost of the respondents do not use any web -based platform to get information about  \\nrangelands.  The answers  including  platforms  refer to national  catalogues  or multi-purpose  \\ngeospatial  platforms.  \\nThe platform  design  should  focus  in computer -based  deployment.  Near all the answers  \\nrequested support for  computers. 30%  request  a mobile  visualization too.  \\nShort films are not of interest for the community, however local case studies, guidelines and  \\nfacts/figures are all requested. \\nNo conclusive  answer  with respect  to the rangelands  bulletin  subscription.\\n\\nData from weather  stations  network  and/or  in-situ measurements  are relevant  for nearly  all the \\nparticipants.  \\nNear 60% of the respondents  accepted  to continue  with the technical  questions.  \\nRegarding  the preferred  visualization  in the platform,  the most common  answer  is maps . On \\nthe visualization  options  there  is no consensus.  All the pre-defined  options  seem  to be of \\ninterest  for the community,  but the preference  is the trend  analysis . Note that this is linked  to \\nthe requirements  stated  in previous  questions  where  analysis  of trends,  dynamics  or changes  \\nwere  highly  demanded.  \\nThe most requested  frequency  updates  for the data hosted  in the platform  are 6-months  and \\nannual . \\nThe community  requested  data,  at least,  from the beginning  of the century  in order  to assess  \\nchanges  (last 20 years ). If possible  30 years  or more.  \\nOn the spatial  aggregation  the participants  indicate  their interest  in averages  at district  and \\ncatchment  level,  and information  at either  10m or 1km depending  on the product.  This is very \\nrelevant to design the platform because having very high resolution products at global level  \\nfor long time  series  drives  the platform  concept  selection.  The storage capability  of the \\nplatform  server  is then one of the deciding  factors.  \\nAll options  presented  to query  data are well received  by the rangelands  community.  \\nNot very demanding time response for data visualization and processing. Majorit y voted the  \\nmost  conservative  option.  \\nThe feature  to download  data is a must  for the potential  users  of the platform.  They  mostly  \\nrequested tabular data and maps . A third of the respondents would like to download raster  \\ndata.  \\nMore  than 80%  of the responses  indicate  their preference  to be able to process their  own \\nproducts . Results disaggregated by  user group  offer the same numbers . This feature is  not \\nonly of interest  for academia,  but also relevant  for Governmental  members,  NGOs  and \\ninternational  agencies.  Processing  capabilities  should  then be available  in the platform  to do, at \\nleast,  statistical  processing  and data layer  merging . Pre-processing  maps  instead  of trends  and \\ndynamics of  different  variables  do not seem  to be a good  option.  Fast-processing  on-the-fly via \\nintegrated  applications,  toolboxes  or notebooks  to cope with the user needs  is required.  \\nUsers  are not particularly  interested  in joining  through  a user login.\\n\\n4.2 User requirements  \\n \\nAfter analysing  collectively  and individually  the answers  to the questionnaire,  the team  \\ntransformed  the needs  into IT requirements  and the most  informant  features  for the design  are \\npresented  here.  \\nOn the data catalogue:  \\n\\u25fc Datasets  from the catalogue  shall be updated  every  6 months  \\n\\u25fc Spatial  resolution  shall be reported  at 1km at national  level and 10m at regional  level \\n\\u25fc At least 20 years  of data is requested  \\n\\u25fc Geospatial  data \\n- To be available  at country  and regional  level \\n- Spatial  aggregations  available  per district  and catchment  \\n- Lot of different  datasets  and products  are of interest,  with priority  for \\n\\u2022 Climate  projections  \\n\\u2022 Time series  of LULC  \\n\\u2022 Time  series  of biomass  \\n\\u2022 Global  and local rangelands  \\n\\u2022 Time  series  of rangelands  condition  \\n\\u2022 Time  series  of livestock  population  \\n\\u2022 Livestock  routes  \\n\\u2022 Livestock  carrying capacity  \\n\\u2022 Time  series  of vegetation  cover  \\n\\u2022 Time  series  of demography  \\n\\u2022 Time series  of soil erosion  \\n\\u2022 Conflicts  \\n\\u25fc Non-geospatial  data \\n- Reports  and documents  \\n- Photos  \\nOn the features:  \\n\\u25fc It shall be possible  to download  data in a variety  of formats  (both  geo and non-geo data)\\n\\n\\u25fc It shall be possible  to upload  data in a variety  of formats  (both  geo and non-geo data) \\n\\u25fc Users  shall be able to process  data \\n- To create  customized  trends  and change  maps  from the time series  data \\n- To customize  aggregated  data (spatial/temporal)  \\n- To combine datasets  \\nOn the visualization:  \\n\\u25fc The platform  shall allow  visualizing  trends,  changes  and dynamics.  \\n- As jpg/png  maps  and graphs  for assessments  \\n- As xls statistics  for reporting  \\n\\u25fc It shall be possible  to query  datasets  per sector,  location,  parameter,  type of data and time \\nperiod.\\n\\n5.0 OUTLINE  AND STRUCTURE  OF THE RANGELANDS  DATA  PLATFORM  \\nThe analysis performed on the user requirements highlights the need for the platform to allow  \\nvisualising  and processing  geospatial  data in a flexible  manner.  There  is no quorum  in the main \\nobjectives  and purposes  the Platform  should  follow,  being  in addition  all the services  and \\ndatasets  proposed  by ILRI and GMV  of interest for  the users. Some  conclusions  can be extracted  \\nby summarising  the results,  but the key issue  to be addressed  in the platform  design  is the \\nplatform  capability  to satisfy  as many  needs  as possible.  Worth  noting  that this would  be only \\npossible  by giving  the user sufficient  options  and features  to customize  the visualization  and \\ndata creation  to fit their daily-work  needs.  \\nWhen  designing  a web-based  geospatial  platform  there  are several  decisions  to be taken  and \\nthat will briefly covered in this chapter. Note that both the study of the existing platforms  \\n[Error! Reference source not found. as well as the IT user requirements extracted from the  \\nresponses of the questionnaire [ Error! Reference source not found. were considered for the  \\nsolutions  proposed.  \\nAn important characteristic to address is the data storage . As presented in [ Error! Reference  \\nsource not found. rangelands commu nities demand, at least, long time series of several  \\nclimate/biophysical/hazard/socio -economic  datasets  at national/regional  level at high spatial  \\nresolution  and with frequent  updates.  Since  geospatial  data already  require  large  storage  \\ncapability  due to their nature,  the demanding  data catalogue  requested  by the users  \\nexacerbate  this issue.  \\nThere  exist,  however,  different  solutions  to deal with this requirement.  One solution  consists  of \\nhosting  the data on local  machines  so that the owner/developer  of the platform  has complete  \\ncontrol  of the data available  in the catalogue,  therefore  ensuring  rapid  access  to these  data \\nsince  no data queries  are needed  to external  servers.  This solution,  local storage,  presents  some  \\nvery important  drawbacks.  It requires  purchasing,  setting  up and maintaining  servers  with large  \\nstorage  capacities  which  is very pricy.  These  servers  also require  updates  when  the platform  \\nneeds  more  storage  or the hardware  becomes  obsolete.  That will happen  at a certain  point \\nbecause  the steady  increase  of the data at every  data update.  In addition,  the Platform  \\ndevelopers  will have  to manually  upload to the  local servers  the new data produced by  the \\nthird party  collaborators  or the new collections  requested  by the users  so that the data can be \\nduly and timely  available  on the Platform.  Daemons  (computer  program  that runs as a \\nbackground  process)  could be  installed in  the servers  of the data producers  to check  the \\navailability  of new data.  But this is not always  possible  and requires  specific  permissions  that \\nmight  be not granted.  \\nAnother  option  for the data  storage is the use of  a cloud -based  storage . This solution  consists  \\nof renting storage on external servers to host the data requested for the platform. In this  \\napproach  the issues  discussed  for local servers are not  applicable.  The rented  capacity  can be\\n\\nexpanded  or reduced  so that it can be adapted  to the needs  of the platform  as it grows.  In \\naddition,  there are already  commercial cloud services  that present geospatial data in their  \\noffer. That is the case of Google Earth Engine, Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services. These  \\ncloud  providers  host in their servers  geospatial  data collections  that are of interest  for \\nrangelands  communities.  Note that data not present  in their catalogues  can be requested  to be \\nadded  or uploaded  following the  approach  described  in the local servers.  \\nIn summary, in order to comply with the requirements regarding the data availability, the  \\nplatform should have great variety of collections at different resolu tions with high periodicity  \\nupdates as well as the possibility to upload data in different formats. Additionally, at least 20  \\nyears  is needed.  All these  reasons  result  in the conclusion  that the optimum  approach  for the \\nplatform relies on the usage of cloud services. Among the possible solutions, Google Earth  \\nEngine  (GEE)  stands  out because  it is currently  the service  with the largest  number  of \\ncollections  incorporated  in its catalogue.  On top of this, most of the success ful and with the \\nmost optimized  performance  geospatial  platforms  employ  GEE as backend,  including  Earth  Map \\nas discussed  with FAO\\u2019s  during  our meeting  [Error!  Reference  source  not found. ]. \\nAnother  relevant  topic is the requirement  on the processed  data.  The platform  could  include  \\ndata pre-processed  on its catalogue  and this would  include  time series  statistics,  combined  data \\nor spatial  aggregations.  These  data can be processed  off-line and added  to the catalogue  by the \\nplatform owner  so it can be directly  visualized  and downloaded  by users.  This might  be an \\ninteresting  option  when  a scientific  team  that knows  well the user community  needs  is behind  \\nthe platform  so they can create  and validate  the processed  data relevant  for the users  (e.g. \\n[RD.10] ). Nevertheless,  based  on the questionnaire  responses,  each group  of users  has different  \\nexpectations  on the platform  design.  To be as compliant  as possible  with the user demands  the \\nbest solution is to provide the user with the capability of processing their data via integrated  \\napplications,  toolboxes  or notebooks.  It would  not necessarily  imply  users  having  programming  \\nskills to develop  their own application,  instead  the platform  developers  can install  pre- \\nconfigured  applications  on the platform  giving  the user possibility  to process  what they need  in \\na friendly  interface  for non-scientific  / non-technical  users.  \\nThe processing  algorithms  will run on either  the local servers  or cloud  services.  The advantages  \\nof a cloud  solution  mentioned  in the storage  section  holds  here too: easily  scalable  to the \\ndemand  and discarded  the need  to purchase  and maintain  local machines.  Moreover,  some  \\nservices  that offer cloud  processing,  already  implement  efficiently  some  of the most common  \\nfunctions  for geospatial  data processing  (e.g. layer combinations,  temporal  and spatial  mean)  \\nfurther  increasing  the preference  to implement  these  services  on the platform.  \\nIn conclusion,  a commercial  cloud  processing  solution  stand  out as the best option  according  to \\nthe meetings  held with the platforms\\u2019  owners  [Error!  Reference  source  not found. ] and to the \\nrequirements discussed in [ Error! Reference source not found. . A variety of the platforms  \\nanalysed use GEE as their processing tool (e.g. [RD.1] , [RD.8] , [RD.9] and [RD.10] ) which is a  \\nsolution  that implements  many  functionalities  aimed  at geospatial  processing  and solves  the \\nstorage  solution,  therefore  it is the most powerful  option  available  for the Rangelands  Data\\n\\nPlatform \\u2019s backend.  At the time of writing  the GMV  team  has had contacted  with Rebecca  \\nMoore,  director  of Google  Earth  and Google  Earth  Engine,  to explore  the possibility  of \\npartnering  in this initiative.  \\nTo address  the challenges  posed  by the rangelands  user community  in the visualization  of the \\ndata,  it is required  a frontend  with enough  functionalities  to integrate  all the tools mentioned  in \\nthe data processing  discussion.  Our analysis  revealed that, currently,  the best options  are \\nMapBox  and TerriaJS . MapBox stands out as the best private option and offers highly  \\ncustomizable  map solutions  for geospatial  websites.  It is implemented  as frontend  solution  on \\n[RD.8]  and [RD.10] . On the other  hand,  TerriaJS  is the best open -source  solution,  consisting  on a \\nframework  for web-based  geospatial  catalogue  and it is implemented,  for instance,  on [RD.2]  \\nand [RD.11] . MapBox  is a relevant  option  when  focusing  on the frontend  customization,  \\nallowing the developer to build its own customized dashboard and thus better adjusting to the  \\nuser's  needs. TerriaJS  is significantly  more  limited  with respect  to the customization.  Worth  \\nnoting  that integrating  the MapBox  solution  in the Rangelands  Data Platform  will require  either  \\npurchasing  a licence  or getting  in-kind support  under  the umbrella  of their Education  program.  \\n \\n \\nAs a final remark it is important to reinforce the idea of the need for a flexible platform that  \\nincludes  a large  storage  capacity  to host a wide variety  of collections  as well as the addition  of \\nprocessing  tools for users.  The conclusion  extracted  from the study  of state-of-the-art platforms  \\nand solutions indicates that the architecture that better adapts to these needs is a platform  \\nwhose  backend  is based  on GEE with a Mapbox  frontend.  This solution  implies  a partnership  \\nwith Google  under  their Google  Cloud  for Researchers  program  and with MapBox  under  their \\nEducation  program.\\n\\n6.0 FINAL  REMARKS  \\nThere is a clear demand for a global Rangelands Data Platform, and this project has gone a  \\nsignificant  way to developing  the Platform  and realising  it. An extensive  consultation  taken  \\nplace  over the last year by ILRI and GMV  which  has allowed  us to identify  what we believe  to be \\nthe best structure and modality for the Platform. The website is set up, and currently has the  \\nRangelands  Atlas  already  available  on it (highlighting  the support  provided  from the Big Data \\nPlatform).  The very successful launc h of the Rangelands Atlas as a first step towards the  \\nRangelands  Data Platform  highlighted  strong  international  organisation  support  for filling  the \\ngaps in big data (partners  on the Atlas were ILRI, FAO,  IUCN,  WWF,  UNEP  and ILC Rangelands  \\nInitiative),  as well extensive  media  coverage.  \\nAt the same  time, we/ILRI  have been  involved  in a number  of events  where  we have firstly  \\nraised  awareness  on the demand  for big data on rangelands,  and secondly  shared  the plans  to \\nlaunch  the Platform.  The Rangelands  Data Platform  was presented  at an international  meeting  \\nheld as an official  side event  of the launch  of the UN Decade  of Ecosystem  Restoration  on 4th \\nJune 2021 (Presentations being put on CGSpace and recording on YouTube). Presentations on  \\nthe Atlas  and the Rangelands  Big Data Platform  were also presented  at the Livestock  Data for \\nDecisions  (LD4D)  Summer  Session,  August  2021.\\n\\nRemaining  tasks  include  looking  at the alignment  of the proposed  structure  and modality  with \\ntwo case study  countries  \\u2013 Kenya  and Kyrgyzstan  \\u2013 and this is underway  through  consultations  \\nwith key stakeholders  there.  Following  this, some  adjustments  may be needed  to ensure  that \\nthe proposed  Platform  best supports  and links with government  platforms  as much  as possible.  \\nIn addition,  at least one brief will be produced  on current  available  data on rangelands  and \\nremaining  gaps.  \\nThe next step will be to finalise  the design  of the Rangelands  Data Platform  and to launch  it. \\nHowever,  for this we want first to ensure  that secure  funding  is available  for the Platform  for at \\nleast 2-3 years  to allow  for further  development,  updating  and maintenance  \\u2013 there  is no point \\nlaunching  a Platform  that we cannot  keep updated.  As such,  we have decided  not to launch  the \\nRangelands  Data Platform  until this is confirmed.  Happily,  the Platform  has been  included  in the \\n1CGIAR Initiative Livestock Climate and System Resilience as an activity, and once budgets are  \\nconfirmed  for the first year we can assess  when  it would  be best to launch  the Platform.  We \\nare also looking  to some  of the international  partners  to provide  financial  support.\\n\\nAppendix  1: Selection  of media  coverage  of launch of  the Rangelands  Atlas \\nDate  Headline  URL Source  Country  Language  Reach  \\n \\n5/28/21  \\n2:34  \\nLa mitad de la superficie  \\nterrestre  del mundo  est\\u00e1 \\nformada  por pastizales   \\nhttps://www.vertigopolitico.com/bienestar/medio -ambiente/notas/la -

Identify if activites carried out are ideations, the development of basic principles, or the validation or testing of well-defined hypotheses. Also include quotes that characterize the setting for the activities carried out. Reflect on if the evidence contains well-defined hypotheses that are being validated or tested under fully-controlled conditions, semi-controlled conditions or uncontrolled conditions. It may be useful to reference the innovation levels (1 through 9) during this step.Finally, make sure to take note of if this innovation is a technological innovation, a capacity development innovation or a policy/organizational/institutional innovation.Write quotes down word for word inside <thinking></thinking> XML tags.

IMPORTANT: It is critical that you distinguish activities which have been carried out from activities which have been planned but not yet carried out.Make sure to recount all major activities that took place within the evidence. In addition to all major activites, the summary should identify any potential innovations that might result from the activities noted and make sure to explicitly state them.

Knowledge Gaps About Sustainability in Pastoralism and Rangelands. With funding from the CGIAR Big Data Platform and through a consultative process the outline of the platform was conceptualised. A global rangelands atlas was launched as a first step. It is anticipated that the global rangelands data platform will be launched in 2023. It will bring together big data on rangelands, source data including exploring crowd-sourcing and be an interactive platform for producing reports and trends for multiple users including UN Agencies monitoring rangeland and development agencies and actors developing interventions for rangelands, researchers and academics, and ultimately pastoralists themselves.\n",

      "control  of the data available  in the catalogue,  therefore  ensuring  rapid  access  to these  data \n",
      "since  no data queries  are needed  to external  servers.  This solution,  local storage,  presents  some  \n",
      "very important  drawbacks.  It requires  purchasing,  setting  up and maintaining  servers  with large  \n",
      "storage  capacities  which  is very pricy.  These  servers  also require  updates  when  the platform  \n",

      "The project began by analyzing existing geospatial platforms to help inform the development of the Rangelands Data Platform. Meetings were held with FAO and GEOGLAM to learn about the architecture and design decisions behind their platforms, Earth Map and RAPP Map.

      "To gather stakeholder input, an online survey was conducted which received 77 responses. The results showed high demand for long time series of climate, land use, livestock, and environmental data at national and regional levels to assess trends and changes in rangelands. Users also requested capabilities to process and download data. \n",

      "In May 2021, the project launched a Rangelands Atlas on the website www.rangelandsdata.org as an initial step toward the full data platform.
