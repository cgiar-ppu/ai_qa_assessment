      " The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework is an international agreement aimed at halting and reversing the loss of biodiversity worldwide by 2030. Some key details about it:\n",

      "- It was originally slated to be finalized and adopted at the 15th Conference of Parties (COP15) to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in Kunming, China in 2020, but this was postponed due to Covid-19. The framework is now expected to be adopted at COP15 in Montreal, Canada in December 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The framework sets 21 targets for 2030 related to things like protecting ecosystems, reducing extinctions, managing invasive species, reducing pollution, ensuring sustainable use of natural resources, and equitably sharing benefits from genetic resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "- It is meant to build on and replace the previous Aichi Biodiversity Targets that were set for 2020 under the UN's Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. Most Aichi Targets were not met.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The framework aims to take a \"whole of government\" and \"whole of society\" approach to mainstreaming biodiversity protection into all sectors of policy and economic activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Financing biodiversity protection and restoration is a major component, with calls for increased funding from public, private and philanthropic sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Indigenous rights and traditional knowledge are also emphasized as being key to conservation efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in summary, it is a major international accord to try to reverse worldwide biodiversity loss this decade by setting targets, mobilizing financing, and getting many actors across society involved.\n"

Poorly designed climate policies that are insen-\\nsitive to pre-existing insecurities and conflict dynamics may inadvertently undermine \\npolitical stability , amplify social inequalities and grievances, and indirectly accelerate \\ndetrimental climate change-related impacts. Peace and security policies that do not \\naccount for the evolving role played by climate change in adding further complexity \\nto intervening contexts may conversely undertake ineffective and climate-insensitive \\ninterventions, and thereby risk locking communities into vicious cycles of  insecu-\\nrity and climate vulnerability . This work contributes to improving the sensitivity of  \\npolicy outputs from climate and environment and peace and security policy sectors \\nto climate-related security considerations by developing a methodological framework \\nthat assesses the degree to which, firstly , policy outputs and strategy documents display \\nawareness of  climate-related security risks and, secondly , recognise opportunities for \\nachieving co-benefits between building climate resilience, conflict prevention and \\npeacebuilding objectives.\\nLiterature review\\nPolicy coherence for an effective climate change response\\nThe impacts of  climate change and variability will be experienced in varying and \\nuneven ways depending on the different extents to which countries, communities \\nand individuals are exposed and vulnerable to climate change impacts or possess \\nadaptive capacity (Pörtner et al., 2022). Exposure and vulnerability are dynamic and \\nvary across temporal and spatial scales, while being driven by ‘patterns of  intersecting \\nsocio-economic development, unsustainable ocean and land use, inequity marginalisa-\\ntion, historical and ongoing patterns of  inequity such as colonialism, and governance’ \\n(Pörtner et al., 2022, 12). As a consequence of  this uneven and complex landscape – in \\nwhich biophysical, socio-economic, political and cultural factors intertwine – policy-\\nmakers are often confronted with seemingly competing strategic priorities. Take, for \\ninstance, a coastal setting at risk of  sea level rise. Governing authorities may need to \\nsimultaneously physically protect the communities who live there, ensure the continu-\\nation of  economic activity and livelihoods, maintain tourism and conserve the local \\nnatural habitat. The policy actions that need to be undertaken to achieve each of  \\nthese things are likely very different from each other, yet policy options must be chosen \\nthat do not necessarily close the door on others and, where possible, act in a synergistic \\nmanner to strengthen a set of  collective goals and desired outcomes.\\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

Within the climate policy realm specifically , the growing complexity \\nof  the global multi-level climate governance architecture has further highlighted \\nthe need for both vertical (between different scales of  governance) and horizontal \\n(between sectors operating at the same level of  governance) coherence. The 2022 \\nIntergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) report, for instance, stresses that \\neffective climate action requires multi-level governance from the local and commu-\\nnity level to national, regional and international levels (IPCC, 2022). The United \\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC) multi-level gover -\\nnance efforts range from relatively top-down agenda and objective setting, strategic \\nprioritisations and targets through to bottom-up, country-led policy frameworks and \\nmechanisms (such as the National Adaptation Plans and the Nationally Determined \\nContributions) and their sub-national level implementation processes. Yet this struc-\\nture is also becoming increasingly fragmented due to the growing recognition that \\nthe framing of  the climate domain or problem structure is broad and interconnected \\nwith a variety of  other fields and sectors. The broader an environmental domain, the \\nmore likely it touches upon other environmental and non-environmental spheres and \\ntheir associated institutions (Zelli and van Asselt, 2013). Effective public policy must \\ntherefore consider the fact that a variety of  complex challenges including growth, \\npoverty reduction and climate change are all hugely interwoven, and that consider -\\nations must be given to interconnections between environmental, social and economic \\nrealms (OECD, 2016; Stern, 2015).\\nConflict risk associated with incoherent climate and peace and  \\nsecurity policies\\nA failure to recognise these interconnections and make provisions within climate \\npolicy design, formulation and implementation process to avoid negative externalities \\nmay at best undermine policy efficacy , and at worst have actively negative local social, \\neconomic and environmental impacts. If  climate adaptation and mitigation objectives \\nand activities are at odds with (local) development strategies and growth plans – or fail \\nto account for local particularities – they may inadvertently undermine the human \\nsecurity of  communities and households. Climate adaptation policies, for instance, \\nif  designed in ways that are insensitive to interconnections across scales and sectors \\n– as well as local socio-cultural and economic characteristics – can have a variety of  \\nunintended spill over effects and negative externalities, potentially causing maladap-\\ntation. Maladaptation can be defined as ‘action taken ostensibly to avoid or reduce \\nvulnerability to climate change that impacts adversely on, or increases the vulner -\\nability of  other systems, sectors, or social groups’ (Barnett and O’Neill, 2010, 211). \\nThe roots of  maladaptation often lie in the lack of  consideration of  long-term adapta-\\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

These maladaptive responses to climate change can, \\naccording to Pörtner et al. (2022) ‘create lock-ins of  vulnerability , exposure, and \\nrisks that are difficult and expensive to change and exacerbate existing inequalities’ \\n(Pörtner et al., 2022, 27).\\nThe risks linked to maladaptation are moreover not spread equally across society . \\nThey especially affect the most vulnerable and marginalised groups that often lack \\nthe social, economic or political capital to weather shocks or ensure sufficient partic-\\nipation and buy-in into policy design and implementation processes. In doing so, \\nmaladaptation can disproportionately burden the most vulnerable, undermine \\nalready existing sources of  resilience and adaptive strategies, and potentially serve \\nto reinforce pre-existing inequalities (particularly for ethnic minorities, indigenous \\npeoples, low-income households and other groups subjected to structural inequalities) \\n(Pörtner et al., 2022; Barnett and O’Neill, 2010). Maladaptive policies or programmes \\nmay therefore – particularly in contexts already characterised by fragility , conflict or \\na legacy of  conflict – inadvertently incentivise violent coping strategies and serve to \\nexacerbate traditional socio-economic and political drivers of  conflict, such as poor \\nor uneven economic growth, intergroup inequalities and relative deprivation, political \\ndiscrimination and exclusion, and illiberal and corrupt state institutions (Cederman et \\nal., 2011; Hegre and Sambanis, 2006; Østby , 2008; Schipper, 2020). In describing this \\nphenomenon, Swatuk et al. (2021) delineate between local level side effects of  insensi-\\ntive climate action and the negative effects of  these local level side effects rebounding \\nback onto the state, labelled as the ‘boomerang effect’. Within this paper, emphasis is \\nplaced on the former of  these.\\nWith regards to climate mitigation policies and activities, Gilmore and Buhaug \\n(2021) outline a typology of  potential pathways to armed conflict, including through \\nincreasing food and fuel prices, a loss of  targeted livelihoods, and adverse distribu-\\ntional effects along pre-existing social cleavages; corruption, rent seeking and unequal \\ndistribution of  benefits locally and internationally; increased consumer vulnerability \\nto commodity and trade shocks, price increases and reduced income; and changes \\nin patterns of  economic growth and employment opportunities with winners and \\nlosers. Mirumachi et al. (2020) similarly argue that the integration of  mitigation prior -\\nities into development trajectories through low carbon development plans can have \\nnotable implications for security . These include those associated with the potentially \\nuneven effects of  low carbon development, in which depoliticised conceptualisations \\nof  growth give rise to technocratic solutions that reproduce patterns of  inequality and \\ndifferential accrual of  benefits depending on socio-economic status or geographical \\nlocation; the over-securitisation of  perceptions and imaginaries of  the global south \\nand a normative bias towards a Westphalian state building model, which permeate \\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

The opposite is also true, however, in that policy efforts to promote peace \\nand security – through, for instance, peacekeeping missions, stabilisation strategies, \\nconflict prevention programmes, post-conflict recovery strategies and peacebuilding \\nefforts – can become ineffectual or at worst actively do harm by failing to recog-\\nnise the role played by climate change. Peacebuilding efforts that do not consider, for \\nexample, how climate change may reshape local social, political and economic reali-\\nties – including how climate factors are likely to influence root and proximate drivers \\nof  conflict – risk producing unresponsive programmes and projects that are unable to \\nadapt or adjust to shifting socio-ecological conditions and the potential new conflict \\ndynamics these may produce. More ‘hard’ security measures, such as military inter -\\nventions, furthermore, often have negative impacts on the livelihoods and resilience \\nof  local populations, for instance by contributing to displacement or restricting the \\nviability of  legal livelihood strategies. Traditional approaches to conflict prevention, \\nstabilisation and peacebuilding also tend to struggle to account for the complex and \\nevolving relationship between climate change and conflict for a variety of  reasons. \\nThese include difficulties in coordinating between the variety of  actors involved in \\nenacting both short- and long-term interventions for humanitarian response and \\nresilience building (often simultaneously) and the need to remain responsive to ever \\nevolving interactions between social, economic and ecological realms in post-conflict \\nsettings (Krampe, 2017).\\nMoreover, recent research has shown that beyond the need to ‘do no harm’ \\n(Anderson, 1999), coherent climate and peace strategies have the potential to produce \\nsignificant co-benefits for one another. Climate action, for instance, contains clear \\nentry points for contributing to a sustainable peace, whilst – vice versa – stabilisation \\nand peacebuilding efforts can create an enabling environment for effective adaptation \\nand mitigation (Morales-Muñoz et al., 2022). Whilst further work is needed at the \\nprogrammatic level to facilitate the emergence of  integrated climate-peace program-\\nming, effective integration on climate-related security risks must also be present at the \\npolicy level – particularly between climate and environment-related and peace and \\nsecurity-related policies.Schapendonk, Sarzana, Savelli, \\nMadurga Lopez, Pacillo and Läderach\\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

Furthermore, despite the growing prominence of  the concept of  coherence \\nin policymaking circles, the principle does not necessarily have a robust definitional \\nfoundation. Understandings of  cross-scalar and cross-sectoral policy coordination are \\nmyriad, with various related concepts pervading academic debates. These include \\npolicy interaction – conceptualised as when one policy measure influences the effect \\nof  a second measure (Boonekamp, 2006); policy integration, defined as creating inter -\\ndependencies between two or more policy domains or the use of  specific instruments \\ndesigned to integrate a set of  considerations or issues across different domains (Candel \\nand Biesbroek, 2016; Tosun and Lang, 2017); and policy coordination, understood as \\ndifferent actors working together in relatively non-hierarchical networks (Jordan and \\nSchout, 2006). For the purposes of  this paper, we follow Lenschow et al. (2018) in \\nviewing interaction, coordination, cooperation and other related concepts as different \\nmechanisms by which coherence can be achieved, all of  which help provide ‘synergic \\nand systematic support towards the achievement of  common objectives within and \\nacross individual policies’ (den Hertog and Stross, 2013,4).\\nThe most well-known policy principles and approaches through which environ-\\nmental and climate-related considerations have thus far been integrated into this set \\nof  common objectives across policy initiatives include principles of  Environmental \\nPolicy Integration (EPI) and the more incipient Climate Policy Integration (CPI). The \\nconcept of  EPI first emerged in the 1990s as a lagged response to the urgent need \\nto systematically connect apparently divergent goals, such as economic competitive-\\nness, social development and environmental protection. It has received widespread \\npolitical backing at the international level, but particularly within the EU, where it \\nenjoys a prominent status. It enshrines the notion of  affording ‘principled priority’ to \\nenvironmental objectives vis-à-vis other policy areas, rather than merely balancing \\nvarious objectives, ensuring that the ‘long-term carrying capacity of  nature becomes a \\nprinciple or overarching societal objective’ (Jordan and Lenschow, 2010; Lafferty and \\nHovden, 2003, 9). However, despite the EU making some attempts to move beyond \\nthis normative understanding and effectively operationalise the principle of  EPI in \\nthe late 1990s and early 2000s – including, for instance, green budgeting, integrated \\npolicy appraisal and impact assessments, and programmatic planning – enshrining \\nEPI through a unified structured set of  practices and processes remains elusive. \\nInstead, sector-specific niches of  EPI have emerged, meaning that what EPI looks \\nlike in practice is often situational (Jordan and Lenschow, 2010).

Conceptualisations \\nof  what CPI means both as a normative principle and in practice are fairly divergent \\n(Adelle and Russel, 2013). Many , however, draw heavily on Lafferty and Hovden’s \\n(2003) definition of  EPI, arguing that CPI is a process giving principled priority to \\nclimate objectives over those of  other policies (Mickwitz et al., 2009). In practice, \\nCPI – similarly to EPI – has struggled to gain traction, with the literature on how to \\nactually undertake CPI generally lacking. Both the concepts of  EPI and CPI, however, \\nrelate primarily to a broader notion of  mainstreaming, focusing on the integration \\nof  one specific policy area into other areas, rather than seeking to build coherence \\nbetween two specific sectors viewed on equal footing (as in the case of  climate and \\nenvironment- and peace and security-related policy areas).\\nSimilarly , with regards to existing approaches to analysing and evaluating policy \\ncoherence, there is something of  a gap with regards to analysing coherence specifi-\\ncally from the perspective of  climate security . The OECD’s PCSD framework, for \\nexample – arguably one of  the most readily accessible tools for policy- and decision-\\nmakers seeking to improve cross-sectoral coherence and containing analytical, insti-\\ntutional and monitoring components – is designed to be flexible and adaptable to \\ndiverse national and institutional contexts, meaning it can be deployed broadly across \\na variety of  policy areas (OECD, 2016). Its analytical component contains evalua-\\ntion criteria related to actors, political leadership, policy interlinkages, enabling and \\ndisabling conditions, sources of  finance and transboundary and intergenerational \\nimpacts. Yet the framework arguably does not contain a sufficient degree of  specificity \\nif  seeking to assess coherence across different policy areas on climate security specifi-\\ncally , currently instead emphasising a set of  normative governance and policymaking \\nnorms and processes – visible for example in the emphasis on stakeholder involvement \\nand political leadership – rather than analysis of  interactions, synergies or conflicts \\nbetween specific policy and strategy documents (Nilsson et al., 2012).\\nDespite the salience of  ensuring cross-sectoral coherence between climate and \\nenvironment-related and peace and security-related policy areas and on ensuring conflict- \\nand climate-sensitivity within these policy areas respectively , surprisingly little work has \\ntherefore been carried out to analyse policy coherence specifically between these fields. \\nExisting examples of  policy coherence analyses conducted on climate and environment-\\nrelated policy and strategy documents focus variously on coherence between climate \\nand livestock (Ashley , 2019); between climate policy at the national and regional level \\nin specific geographies, such as amongst Small Island Developing States (SIDS) or the \\nCaribbean (Lewis and Su, 2021; Scobie, 2016); between national level adaptation goals \\nand specific sectors (England et al., 2018; Kalaba et al., 2014; Ranabhat et al., 2018); \\nbetween climate and tourism policies (Santos-Lacueva and Velasco González, 2018), \\namongst other examples. Specific analysis of  how climate and environment- and peace \\nand security-related policies interact is, however, generally absent.\\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

To test this framework, a diagnostic \\nanalysis is conducted, which – grounded in the research questions set out below – \\nidentifies trends and patterns in the way sectoral actors across different countries have \\nengaged with the topic of  climate security and the degree to which coherence exists \\nbetween these sectors both horizontally (at the national level) and vertically (between \\nnational and regional levels). Specifically , this paper will seek to answer the following \\nquestions:\\n• To what extent are climate and environment- and peace and security-related \\npolicies and strategies ‘aware’ of  the topic of  climate security and specific \\nclimate-related security risks that may exist in intervening contexts?\\n• To what extent do policies and strategies that do demonstrate awareness of  \\nclimate-related security risks translate this awareness into strategic priorities and \\nobjectives?\\n• To what degree do policies and strategies contain specific programmatic activi-\\nties, projects, and other implementation strategies that are climate security-\\nsensitive and coherent across climate and environment- and peace and security-\\nrelated realms?\\nOn the basis of  this analysis, a set of  recommendations is made to policymakers \\nand planners to further the coherence between policy domains and the effective \\nintegration of  climate-related security risks into policy outputs.\\nMethodology\\nOur method for analysing policy coherence between climate and environment- and \\npeace and security-related policy documents builds upon a variety of  approaches \\nfor assessing and understanding policy coherence, with different approaches often \\nmaking use of  different modalities through which an assessment is undertaken. Our \\nmethod, however, whilst using these previously deployed principled of  policy coher -\\nence analysis, diverges from previous analysis by employing climate security-specific \\nvariables within our assessment framework (Table 1).\\nDifferent existing approaches were considered and incorporated on the basis of  \\nseveral analytical considerations. Firstly , as we hypothesised that the majority of  policy \\nand strategy documents would have very limited engagement or entirely fail to engage \\nwith climate security as a topic and area of  concern, part of  our analysis necessarily \\nfocused on assessing ‘awareness’, or conceptual clarity .

These ‘stimulations’ are here understood to \\noccur through how climate affects human security (in combination with a broader \\nrange of  socio-economic factors, such as poverty , the degree of  support or conversely \\ndiscrimination that a community receives from the state, access to economic opportu-\\nnities, degree of  social cohesion, policy effectiveness, amongst others) in various ways, \\nin essence acting as an intermediary variable between climate change impacts and \\nconflict (Barnett and Adger, 2007; Daoudy , 2021).\\nSecondly , a distinction was made between climate security awareness, coherence at \\nthe strategic level and objective-setting components, and coherence at the implemen-\\ntation level and implementation-related components of  a policy or strategy . Nilsson \\net al. (2012), for instance, understand an assessment of  coherence to encompass policy \\noutputs – ‘the decisions on objectives and instruments that are meant to achieve policy \\ngoals’ – and policy implementation, or ‘the arrangements by authorities and other \\nactors for putting policy instruments into action’ (Nilsson et al., 2012:  3). Schnabel \\nand Witt (2022) similarly distinguish between policy coherence at the strategic level \\n– including strategic orientation and planning activities – and the implementation \\nlevel, encompassing the instruments and specific activities outlined in a given policy or \\nstrategy . As such, our method evaluates coherence at the strategic and objective-setting \\nlevel – such as whether specific objectives relating to climate security , or the mitigation \\nof  climate-related security risks are present across different policies or strategies – as \\nwell as at the implementation level. For the latter, our method evaluates the presence \\nand coherence of  policy instruments (either entirely new ones created for the purpose \\nof  climate security or the integration of  climate security considerations into existing \\nones), specific programmatic activities outlined in action plans, and the identification \\nof  specific communities or beneficiaries at risk of  climate-related security risks (Table \\n1). Importantly , coding was centred around both implicit and explicit climate security \\nconsiderations. This means that for instance an objective or programmatic activity \\nwhich did not explicitly address climate-related security risks – but which indirectly \\ncontributed to the mitigation of  said risks, for instance through engaging in climate \\nsmart agricultural (CSA) practices and thereby reducing livelihood insecurity – was \\ncoded as implicitly contributing to the mitigation of  climate-related security risks and \\nthereby forming an opportunity for further integration of  climate-related security \\nconsiderations.\\nThirdly , our method enables the evaluation of  policy and strategic coherence both \\nhorizontally (at the same level of  governance) and vertically (across different levels of  \\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

This is in line with den Hertog and Stross (2013), who – in their analysis \\nof  EU law and foreign policy – emphasise the need for a multi-level understanding of  \\ncoherence and to examine its achievement in both a horizontal and a vertical sense. \\nInterconnections between policies and strategies at different levels are as such assessed \\nthrough whether a policy or strategy document makes reference to or builds upon \\na policy or strategy produced at a different level of  governance (restricted to either \\nregional or national levels within this paper) (Table 1).\\nThe method used for evaluating awareness of  climate-related security risks and \\ncoherence between the policy areas included in this analysis was designed in a hybrid \\nmanner, cognisant of  the fact that whilst empirical results were required for effective \\ncross-comparison of  trends, patterns and results, policy analysis remains a qualitative \\nand subjective analytical exercise. The method was also created to possess sufficient \\nspecificity to produce useful insights with regards to which thematic or technical areas \\na policy output or strategy could be argued to fall short in. As such, the hybrid frame-\\nwork is composed of  both directed content analysis and an empirical scoring system, \\nwith the former acting as the foundations for the latter. Directed content analysis \\ncan be utilised to validate or extend conceptually a pre-existing theoretical frame-\\nwork or theory , and is therefore useful in the ex-ante creation of  analytical categories \\nthrough which bodies of  text can be assessed (Hsieh and Shannon, 2005). In line \\nwith our research questions and building on previous understandings and assessments \\nof  coherence within existing literature, a number of  analytical categories were thus \\ncreated to analyse coherence in a deductive manner (Table 1).\\nEach of  the categories outlined in Table 1 therefore represents a domain deemed \\nof  relevance for coherence and the adequate incorporation of  climate-related security \\nrisks, based on which an evaluation could be made by the researchers. To do so in a \\nway that produced empirical and quantifiable results, one to two questions were devel-\\noped within each category which the researcher would answer with either a ‘yes’ or a \\n‘no’ (corresponding to a 1 or a 0 respectively). This subsequently formed the basis of  \\na policy scoring system in which the lowest attainable score is 0 and the highest is 12.\\nTo ensure the validity of  our results, we deployed a number of  quality assur -\\nance techniques at various stages of  the analysis. Firstly , it was important to consider \\nwhether the concepts and categories we developed were adequately reflective of  \\nthe phenomenon under assessment. To ensure this, a small sub-set of  the selected \\ndocuments (around 15–20 per cent) were utilised to check the appropriateness of  the \\ncategorisations, after which a series of  small adjustments were made to the framework \\n(Islam and Asadullah, 2018). These adjustments mainly centred around clarifying and \\nnarrowing the assessment criteria, such as establishing what exactly constituted an \\nacceptable definition of  climate security , what represented recognition of  specific \\nclimate-conflict linkages within policy documents, and how to define what comprised \\nan implicit contribution to the mitigation of  climate-related security risks.

Due to the complex feedback processes that exist between climate \\nchange and climate vulnerability on the one hand and conflict and fragility on the \\nother, these contexts in particular are arguably at high risk of  becoming locked into \\nhard-to-break cycles of  climate vulnerability , insecurity and conflict. Addressing these \\ninterlinkages in policy and maximising the co-benefits of  climate action, conflict \\nprevention and peacebuilding is therefore acute. The rationale for focusing on Africa \\ndraws from the increasing interest on the topic in the continent as illustrated by the \\nBamako Declaration on Access to Natural Resources and Conflicts between Commu-\\nnities released in 2019 in which the African Union acknowledged the interconnec-\\ntions between climate and conflict and called for the need to develop effective policy \\nresponses to address these interconnected risks (African Union Peace and Security \\nCouncil, 2019).\\nIn order to identify and extract relevant policy and strategy documents produced \\nby national governments and regional level entities, a keyword search strategy was \\ndeveloped based on the key concepts identified by the research questions. Boolean \\noperators were used to help enhance and narrow down the keyword search by estab-\\nlishing relationships between the different terms through the use of  the connector \\n‘ AND’, used to only retrieve the documents that mention all of  the terms included \\nin the search (for instance, searching for ‘climate’ AND ‘policy’ AND ‘[country]’). \\nThese Boolean operators were deployed in the New Climate Institute’s Climate Policy \\nDatabase and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environ-\\nment’s Climate Change Laws of  the World Database, as well as throughout relevant \\nclimate and environment- and peace and security-related ministerial websites across \\nthe eight countries subjected to analysis. A set of  inclusion and exclusion criteria \\nfor extracted policy and strategy documents was subsequently developed based on \\nthe thematic priorities identified by the research questions, and helped establish the \\nsectoral, temporal and geographical scope of  the analysis. The scope of  analysis was \\nlimited to policy and strategy documents extracted from climate and environment-\\nrelated fields climate change fields (i.e. adaptation and mitigation) and from peace \\nand security-related fields (e.g. social cohesion, conflict prevention/transformation, \\nand peacebuilding; counterterrorism and extremist prevention; stabilisation and post-\\nconflict recovery).\\nThese inclusion criteria were developed as the scope of  this research is focused on \\nassessing awareness of  and coherence on climate security specifically within climate \\nand environment- and peace and security-related policies and strategies.

Peace and \\nsecurity-related policies and strategies were slightly more likely to deploy a concep-\\ntually appropriate understanding (25 per cent of  national level and 10 per cent of  \\nregional level documents).\\nSimilarly , recognition of  differing rates of  change within climate- and socio-\\neconomic, political and development processes – and how this may impact the \\nemergence of  climate-related security risks – was extremely rare, with only 2 per cent \\nof  climate and environment-related and no peace and security-related policies and \\nstrategies displaying evidence of  awareness regarding this, across both the assessed \\nscales of  governance (temporal coherence) (Table 2). It is also notable that at both the \\nnational and the regional level, climate and environment-related policies and strategies \\nwere much more likely to recognise specific climate-related security risks or conflict \\noutcomes than peace and security-related documents, although they were slightly less \\nlikely to make use of  a conceptually sound understanding of  climate security .

Forty-five per cent of  national level and 40 per cent of  \\nregional level climate and environment-related policies – as well as 32 per cent of  \\nnational level peace and security-related policies – were found to contain activities and \\nprogrammatic interventions either explicitly or implicitly related to climate security . \\nRegional level peace and security-related policies and strategies were the least likely \\nto contain specific programmatic interventions related directly or indirectly to climate \\nsecurity . Finally , climate and environment-related policies and strategies demonstrated \\na greater tendency to identify specific communities and geographies at risk of  climate \\nchange impacts or climate-related security risks. Thirty-nine per cent of  national \\nand 33 per cent of  regional climate and environment-related policies and strategies \\ndisplayed the level of  granularity needed to truly undertake responsive programming, \\nwhilst only 19 per cent of  national level and 10 per cent of  regional level peace and \\nsecurity-related policies and strategies did so. It should be noted, however, that despite \\nclimate and environment-related generally outperforming peace and security-related \\npolicies and strategies in all of  the implementation-related evaluation categories, the \\noverall presence of  instruments, specific programmatic interventions, and the degree \\nto which specific at risk-communities and geographies were identified in a climate \\nsecurity-relevant manner is low. Regional level peace and security-related policies \\nperformed particularly poorly in this regard.\\nDiscussion and recommendations\\nFirstly , it is apparent that whilst both climate and environment- and peace and \\nsecurity-related policies and strategies do engage with (and demonstrate awareness \\nof) specific climate-conflict linkages, these are much less likely to be underpinned \\nby a robust conceptual understanding of  the concept of  climate security . Although \\nclimate-related conflict and security implications are quite regularly recognised as \\nbeing present in intervening contexts, the frequent absence of  a clear and workable \\ndefinition of  climate security perhaps indicates a lack of  appropriate frameworks of  \\nunderstanding for how climate change may undermine human security (and how \\nresponses to alleviating said insecurity can contribute to conflict and violence). It \\nis also the case, however, that climate and environment-related policies are at both \\nthe national and regional level more likely to contain recognition of  climate-conflict \\nlinkages. The fact that a shared conceptual understanding is often lacking amongst \\npolicies and strategies of  both policy areas additionally limits opportunities for cross-\\nsectoral coherence, as policymakers active in different policy spaces are not able to \\noperate within the same conceptual framing.

Academic \\nand practitioner fields have, however, thus far struggled to facilitate cross-fertilisation \\nbetween competing ontological positions, epistemological foundations and method-\\nological approaches on the relationship between climate change and violent conflict \\n(Ide et al., 2023), which may also influence and prohibit the development of  effective \\npolicy .\\nSecondly , our results suggest that climate and environment-related policies and \\nstrategies are generally more likely to recognise specific instances of  climate-conflict \\nlinkages; display interconnectedness with either other sector-specific policie0s and \\nstrategies or overarching development and growth strategies; contain objectives and \\nstrategic priorities at least implicitly related to mitigating climate-related security risks \\n(therefore displaying the greatest opportunity for integrating climate security-related \\nconcerns); and outline specific programmatic activities and projects either directly or \\nindirectly related to mitigating climate-related security risks. Peace and security-related \\npolicies – both at the national and regional levels, but particularly the latter – are far \\nless likely to engage with other sectors or display integration into overarching, cross-\\nsectoral strategies or contain opportunities for the integration of  climate security-\\nrelated considerations at the strategic and implementation levels. Whilst current \\ncross-sectoral policy linkages therefore do not appear to be sufficiently present for an \\neffective, integrated approach to climate security policymaking, regional peace and \\nsecurity-related strategies in particular currently display very minimal opportunity \\nfor the incorporation of  climate security . These results may partially , however, be a \\nreflection of  the fact that less peace and security-related policies and strategies were \\nextracted and included in the dataset used for this analysis than climate and environ-\\nment-related policies.\\nThirdly , it is apparent that – despite evidence for a sophisticated understanding \\nof  climate security being limited – the potential for climate security-related consid-\\nerations to be integrated into existing objectives, strategic priorities, policy instru-\\nments, baseline assessments and identifying at risk areas and groups, and specific \\nprogrammes and projects does exist. A substantial number of  objectives, the policy \\ninstruments used to transpose these to local levels, and the local level programmes and \\nactivities that help achieve priorities locally , were found to implicitly mitigate climate-\\nrelated security risks and pathways, primarily by seeking to alleviate climate-related \\nimpacts on human security . Consideration of  co-benefits for peace, security and \\nsocial cohesion, however, is limited in the vast majority of  these instances.

Firstly , it is imperative that both academic and practitioner litera-\\nture achieves a greater degree of  conceptual clarity on how to frame and operation-\\nalise the relationship between climate change and violent conflict (Ide et al., 2023). \\nOur research has shown that this likely extends beyond the purely academic realm \\nand represents more than an intellectual exercise. There may therefore be utility for \\npolicymakers from across climate and environment- and peace and security-related \\npolicy areas to access a shared conceptual space where interconnections and synergies \\nbetween climate and security can be explored and maximised, particularly in identi-\\nfying specific programmes, projects or initiatives where climate and conflict sensitivity \\nand peace responsiveness could be better integrated.\\nInnovation and the scaling-up of  innovative developments within the field of  \\nclimate security (including the development of  climate security-specific programmatic \\ninterventions) requires the buy-in of  a multitude of  interconnected and interdepen-\\ndent stakeholders active in the space that can form coalitions of  change (Sartas et al., \\n2020). For climate security , these are likely to include (but not necessarily be limited \\nto) researchers from across diverse epistemologies, both climate action and peace \\npractitioners, multilateral institutions, states and sub-national and community-level \\norganisations. The construction of  these coalitions requires stakeholders being able to \\nlearn about one another’s context and perspectives, discover how they depend on one \\nanother to fulfil their ambitions, develop common starting points to build upon, and \\ndevelop mutual relationships and trust (Kahan and Rapoport, 2014). This facilitated \\nlearning and negotiation process cannot occur, however, without these diverse stake-\\nholders operating on the basis of  a common definition and using a widely accepted \\nset of  terms, approaches, frameworks and data types – the absence of  which is clear \\non the basis of  our policy analysis. Ensuring a unified conceptual base is therefore a \\nkey priority for government actors within the field of  climate security .\\nGiven how context-specific recognition of  climate-conflict linkages is to some \\ndegree present however, it is also critical for academics and practitioners to strengthen \\ntheir ability to learn from the policy community itself  (and those informing the policy-\\nmaking process). In particular, researcher and practitioner communities should invest \\nto a much greater degree in localised and bottom-up knowledge co-creation processes. \\nThis has proved challenging, however, given the limited availability of  information \\nand data that can help paint a picture of  specific local dynamics and the variables and \\ndrivers involved in them. A greater emphasis should therefore be placed on working \\ntogether with relevant government agencies, sub-national and community-level struc-\\ntures to co-define climate-related security risks and co-design potential interventions \\nto address these, underscoring the importance of  knowledge co-creation and decolo-\\nnising the field of  climate security (Siddiqi, 2022).\\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

Policymaking actors \\nand institutions active in the peace and security space in particular should therefore \\nmore actively consider the role of  climate change in contributing to risks of  conflict \\nand threats to social cohesion, whilst also reflecting to a much greater degree the \\nopportunities climate change may bring for cooperation in their strategic priorities, \\nobjectives and programmatic activities. Furthermore, as our results suggest that cross-\\nsectoral interaction between peace and security-related policies and strategies and \\nother policy areas is much more limited than is the case for climate and environment-\\nrelated policies, there is a need to construct more robust cross-sectoral linkages and \\nmake sure of  existing vehicles and spaces for coordination for the purposes of  climate \\nsecurity coordination. One practical method through which a greater awareness of  \\nthe relationship between climate change and conflict amongst those working in peace \\nand security could be to, firstly , undertake training needs assessments (TNAs) within \\nkey country and regional level bodies and entities in order to assess gaps in under -\\nstanding, skills or capacities with regards to the topic of  climate security . This should \\nbe followed, secondly , by specific climate security-related capacity building efforts to \\nrespond to potential shortcomings in understanding and capacity .\\nFinally , as our analysis suggests that (particularly in climate and environment-\\nrelated policies and strategies) the opportunity for incorporating climate security-\\nrelated considerations and priorities is quite substantial, efforts to chart how and to \\nintegrate co-benefits for peace, security and social cohesion into existing program-\\nmatic activities and projects should be undertaken in a systemic manner. To do so, \\nthose working in technical capacities within relevant ministries, agencies and other \\npolicymaking entities could engage in internal analytical and mapping exercises such \\nas those outlined by Morales-Muñoz et al. (2022) Making use of  a system dynamics \\nmodel and creating causal loop diagrams can, for example, can help chart context-\\nspecific relationships with the climate-conflict and climate-peace nexus, the interme-\\ndiate variables that influence the intensity and speed at which said relationships may \\nmanifest, and identify correlations and feedbacks between these (both positive and \\nnegative). This in turn would allow climate and environment- as well as peace and \\nsecurity-related institutions and entities to identify exactly where in this complex set of  \\nrelationships they are likely able to either amplify positive or mitigate negative correla-\\ntions between climate change and social systems, and which specific programmatic \\nactivities may be required to do so. Integrating such exercises at the very beginning of  \\na policy formulation process can help better integrate climate security considerations \\nin a systematic manner.

To do so, it makes use of  an innovative policy analysis method designed to \\ncapture and evaluate analytical variables that are specifically relevant to assessing \\nthe presence of  climate security-related considerations in the policy documents, as \\nwell as the degree to which coherence appears to exist across climate and environ-\\nment- and peace and security-related fields. Using this method, this paper finds that \\nalthough specific climate-conflict linkages are to a certain extent recognised within \\npolicies from both sectors, a clear and shared conceptual understanding of  climate \\nsecurity is mostly lacking; climate and environment-related policies and strategies are \\ngenerally more aware of  climate security and have greater cross-sectoral linkages than \\npeace and security-related policies and strategies, which appear to operate in a more \\nsiloed manner; and that there are – particularly within climate and environment-\\nrelated policies and strategies – opportunities for the integration of  climate security-\\nrelated considerations into existing objectives and strategic priorities, instruments \\nand programmatic activities and projects. As a consequence of  these findings, this \\npaper recommends that academic and practitioner climate security research fields \\nwork to achieve a greater degree of  conceptual clarity and cooperates more effec-\\ntively with government agencies, sub-national entities and communities to generate \\ncontext-specific understandings of  climate security; that peace and security policy-\\nmaking institutions – particularly at the regional level – undertake internal TNAs to \\nassess shortcomings in knowledge and capacities with regard to climate security and \\ndesign capacity building efforts as appropriate; and that current opportunities for the \\nintegration of  climate security-related considerations and climate-peace co-benefits \\nare identified more clearly through the use of  exercises such as system dynamics \\nmodelling, which can be included in the policy design and formulation process.\\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

      "    \"description\": \"The increasing interconnected nature of our world means that failing to achieve coherence between climate- and peace and security-related policy domains forms a significant climate-related security risk. Poorly designed climate policies that are insensitive to pre-existing insecurities and conflict dynamics may undermine political stability, amplify social inequalities and grievances, and accelerate a loss of biodiversity and climate change-related impacts. Peace and security policies that do not account for climate risks may conversely promote ineffective and unresponsive interventions and risk locking communities into vicious cycles of insecurity and climate vulnerability. This work contributes to the climate security proofing of policy outputs by developing a methodological framework that assesses the degree to which policy outputs and strategy documents display awareness of climate-related security risks and climate peace opportunities. This framework is used to assess policies and strategies from across eight African countries. We find that despite some limited recognition of often place-specific climate-related security risks, a clear and shared conceptual understanding of the climate, peace and security nexus is generally lacking; climate and environment-related policies are generally more aware of climate security and have greater cross-sectoral engagement than peace and security-related policies; and that opportunities exist for the integration of climate security-related considerations into existing strategic priorities, instruments, and programmatic activities.\"\n",

      "The increasing interconnected nature of our world means that failing to achieve coherence between climate- and peace and security-related policy domains forms a significant climate-related security risk. Poorly designed climate policies that are insensitive to pre-existing insecurities and conflict dynamics may undermine political stability, amplify social inequalities and grievances, and accelerate a loss of biodiversity and climate change-related impacts. Peace and security policies that do not account for climate risks may conversely promote ineffective and unresponsive interventions and risk locking communities into vicious cycles of insecurity and climate vulnerability. This work contributes to the climate security proofing of policy outputs by developing a methodological framework that assesses the degree to which policy outputs and strategy documents display awareness of climate-related security risks and climate peace opportunities. This framework is used to assess policies and strategies from across eight African countries. We find that despite some limited recognition of often place-specific climate-related security risks, a clear and shared conceptual understanding of the climate, peace and security nexus is generally lacking; climate and environment-related policies are generally more aware of climate security and have greater cross-sectoral engagement than peace and security-related policies; and that opportunities exist for the integration of climate security-related considerations into existing strategic priorities, instruments, and programmatic activities.\n",

Poorly designed climate policies that are insen-\\nsitive to pre-existing insecurities and conflict dynamics may inadvertently undermine \\npolitical stability , amplify social inequalities and grievances, and indirectly accelerate \\ndetrimental climate change-related impacts. Peace and security policies that do not \\naccount for the evolving role played by climate change in adding further complexity \\nto intervening contexts may conversely undertake ineffective and climate-insensitive \\ninterventions, and thereby risk locking communities into vicious cycles of  insecu-\\nrity and climate vulnerability . This work contributes to improving the sensitivity of  \\npolicy outputs from climate and environment and peace and security policy sectors \\nto climate-related security considerations by developing a methodological framework \\nthat assesses the degree to which, firstly , policy outputs and strategy documents display \\nawareness of  climate-related security risks and, secondly , recognise opportunities for \\nachieving co-benefits between building climate resilience, conflict prevention and \\npeacebuilding objectives.\\nLiterature review\\nPolicy coherence for an effective climate change response\\nThe impacts of  climate change and variability will be experienced in varying and \\nuneven ways depending on the different extents to which countries, communities \\nand individuals are exposed and vulnerable to climate change impacts or possess \\nadaptive capacity (P\\u00f6rtner et al., 2022). Exposure and vulnerability are dynamic and \\nvary across temporal and spatial scales, while being driven by \\u2018patterns of  intersecting \\nsocio-economic development, unsustainable ocean and land use, inequity marginalisa-\\ntion, historical and ongoing patterns of  inequity such as colonialism, and governance\\u2019 \\n(P\\u00f6rtner et al., 2022, 12). As a consequence of  this uneven and complex landscape \\u2013 in \\nwhich biophysical, socio-economic, political and cultural factors intertwine \\u2013 policy-\\nmakers are often confronted with seemingly competing strategic priorities. Take, for \\ninstance, a coastal setting at risk of  sea level rise. Governing authorities may need to \\nsimultaneously physically protect the communities who live there, ensure the continu-\\nation of  economic activity and livelihoods, maintain tourism and conserve the local \\nnatural habitat. The policy actions that need to be undertaken to achieve each of  \\nthese things are likely very different from each other, yet policy options must be chosen \\nthat do not necessarily close the door on others and, where possible, act in a synergistic \\nmanner to strengthen a set of  collective goals and desired outcomes.\\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

Within the climate policy realm specifically , the growing complexity \\nof  the global multi-level climate governance architecture has further highlighted \\nthe need for both vertical (between different scales of  governance) and horizontal \\n(between sectors operating at the same level of  governance) coherence. The 2022 \\nIntergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) report, for instance, stresses that \\neffective climate action requires multi-level governance from the local and commu-\\nnity level to national, regional and international levels (IPCC, 2022). The United \\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change\\u2019s (UNFCCC) multi-level gover -\\nnance efforts range from relatively top-down agenda and objective setting, strategic \\nprioritisations and targets through to bottom-up, country-led policy frameworks and \\nmechanisms (such as the National Adaptation Plans and the Nationally Determined \\nContributions) and their sub-national level implementation processes. Yet this struc-\\nture is also becoming increasingly fragmented due to the growing recognition that \\nthe framing of  the climate domain or problem structure is broad and interconnected \\nwith a variety of  other fields and sectors. The broader an environmental domain, the \\nmore likely it touches upon other environmental and non-environmental spheres and \\ntheir associated institutions (Zelli and van Asselt, 2013). Effective public policy must \\ntherefore consider the fact that a variety of  complex challenges including growth, \\npoverty reduction and climate change are all hugely interwoven, and that consider -\\nations must be given to interconnections between environmental, social and economic \\nrealms (OECD, 2016; Stern, 2015).\\nConflict risk associated with incoherent climate and peace and  \\nsecurity policies\\nA failure to recognise these interconnections and make provisions within climate \\npolicy design, formulation and implementation process to avoid negative externalities \\nmay at best undermine policy efficacy , and at worst have actively negative local social, \\neconomic and environmental impacts. If  climate adaptation and mitigation objectives \\nand activities are at odds with (local) development strategies and growth plans \\u2013 or fail \\nto account for local particularities \\u2013 they may inadvertently undermine the human \\nsecurity of  communities and households. Climate adaptation policies, for instance, \\nif  designed in ways that are insensitive to interconnections across scales and sectors \\n\\u2013 as well as local socio-cultural and economic characteristics \\u2013 can have a variety of  \\nunintended spill over effects and negative externalities, potentially causing maladap-\\ntation. Maladaptation can be defined as \\u2018action taken ostensibly to avoid or reduce \\nvulnerability to climate change that impacts adversely on, or increases the vulner -\\nability of  other systems, sectors, or social groups\\u2019 (Barnett and O\\u2019Neill, 2010, 211). \\nThe roots of  maladaptation often lie in the lack of  consideration of  long-term adapta-\\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

These maladaptive responses to climate change can, \\naccording to P\\u00f6rtner et al. (2022) \\u2018create lock-ins of  vulnerability , exposure, and \\nrisks that are difficult and expensive to change and exacerbate existing inequalities\\u2019 \\n(P\\u00f6rtner et al., 2022, 27).\\nThe risks linked to maladaptation are moreover not spread equally across society . \\nThey especially affect the most vulnerable and marginalised groups that often lack \\nthe social, economic or political capital to weather shocks or ensure sufficient partic-\\nipation and buy-in into policy design and implementation processes. In doing so, \\nmaladaptation can disproportionately burden the most vulnerable, undermine \\nalready existing sources of  resilience and adaptive strategies, and potentially serve \\nto reinforce pre-existing inequalities (particularly for ethnic minorities, indigenous \\npeoples, low-income households and other groups subjected to structural inequalities) \\n(P\\u00f6rtner et al., 2022; Barnett and O\\u2019Neill, 2010). Maladaptive policies or programmes \\nmay therefore \\u2013 particularly in contexts already characterised by fragility , conflict or \\na legacy of  conflict \\u2013 inadvertently incentivise violent coping strategies and serve to \\nexacerbate traditional socio-economic and political drivers of  conflict, such as poor \\nor uneven economic growth, intergroup inequalities and relative deprivation, political \\ndiscrimination and exclusion, and illiberal and corrupt state institutions (Cederman et \\nal., 2011; Hegre and Sambanis, 2006; \\u00d8stby , 2008; Schipper, 2020). In describing this \\nphenomenon, Swatuk et al. (2021) delineate between local level side effects of  insensi-\\ntive climate action and the negative effects of  these local level side effects rebounding \\nback onto the state, labelled as the \\u2018boomerang effect\\u2019. Within this paper, emphasis is \\nplaced on the former of  these.\\nWith regards to climate mitigation policies and activities, Gilmore and Buhaug \\n(2021) outline a typology of  potential pathways to armed conflict, including through \\nincreasing food and fuel prices, a loss of  targeted livelihoods, and adverse distribu-\\ntional effects along pre-existing social cleavages; corruption, rent seeking and unequal \\ndistribution of  benefits locally and internationally; increased consumer vulnerability \\nto commodity and trade shocks, price increases and reduced income; and changes \\nin patterns of  economic growth and employment opportunities with winners and \\nlosers. Mirumachi et al. (2020) similarly argue that the integration of  mitigation prior -\\nities into development trajectories through low carbon development plans can have \\nnotable implications for security . These include those associated with the potentially \\nuneven effects of  low carbon development, in which depoliticised conceptualisations \\nof  growth give rise to technocratic solutions that reproduce patterns of  inequality and \\ndifferential accrual of  benefits depending on socio-economic status or geographical \\nlocation; the over-securitisation of  perceptions and imaginaries of  the global south \\nand a normative bias towards a Westphalian state building model, which permeate \\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

The opposite is also true, however, in that policy efforts to promote peace \\nand security \\u2013 through, for instance, peacekeeping missions, stabilisation strategies, \\nconflict prevention programmes, post-conflict recovery strategies and peacebuilding \\nefforts \\u2013 can become ineffectual or at worst actively do harm by failing to recog-\\nnise the role played by climate change. Peacebuilding efforts that do not consider, for \\nexample, how climate change may reshape local social, political and economic reali-\\nties \\u2013 including how climate factors are likely to influence root and proximate drivers \\nof  conflict \\u2013 risk producing unresponsive programmes and projects that are unable to \\nadapt or adjust to shifting socio-ecological conditions and the potential new conflict \\ndynamics these may produce. More \\u2018hard\\u2019 security measures, such as military inter -\\nventions, furthermore, often have negative impacts on the livelihoods and resilience \\nof  local populations, for instance by contributing to displacement or restricting the \\nviability of  legal livelihood strategies. Traditional approaches to conflict prevention, \\nstabilisation and peacebuilding also tend to struggle to account for the complex and \\nevolving relationship between climate change and conflict for a variety of  reasons. \\nThese include difficulties in coordinating between the variety of  actors involved in \\nenacting both short- and long-term interventions for humanitarian response and \\nresilience building (often simultaneously) and the need to remain responsive to ever \\nevolving interactions between social, economic and ecological realms in post-conflict \\nsettings (Krampe, 2017).\\nMoreover, recent research has shown that beyond the need to \\u2018do no harm\\u2019 \\n(Anderson, 1999), coherent climate and peace strategies have the potential to produce \\nsignificant co-benefits for one another. Climate action, for instance, contains clear \\nentry points for contributing to a sustainable peace, whilst \\u2013 vice versa \\u2013 stabilisation \\nand peacebuilding efforts can create an enabling environment for effective adaptation \\nand mitigation (Morales-Mu\\u00f1oz et al., 2022). Whilst further work is needed at the \\nprogrammatic level to facilitate the emergence of  integrated climate-peace program-\\nming, effective integration on climate-related security risks must also be present at the \\npolicy level \\u2013 particularly between climate and environment-related and peace and \\nsecurity-related policies.Schapendonk, Sarzana, Savelli, \\nMadurga Lopez, Pacillo and L\\u00e4derach\\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

Furthermore, despite the growing prominence of  the concept of  coherence \\nin policymaking circles, the principle does not necessarily have a robust definitional \\nfoundation. Understandings of  cross-scalar and cross-sectoral policy coordination are \\nmyriad, with various related concepts pervading academic debates. These include \\npolicy interaction \\u2013 conceptualised as when one policy measure influences the effect \\nof  a second measure (Boonekamp, 2006); policy integration, defined as creating inter -\\ndependencies between two or more policy domains or the use of  specific instruments \\ndesigned to integrate a set of  considerations or issues across different domains (Candel \\nand Biesbroek, 2016; Tosun and Lang, 2017); and policy coordination, understood as \\ndifferent actors working together in relatively non-hierarchical networks (Jordan and \\nSchout, 2006). For the purposes of  this paper, we follow Lenschow et al. (2018) in \\nviewing interaction, coordination, cooperation and other related concepts as different \\nmechanisms by which coherence can be achieved, all of  which help provide \\u2018synergic \\nand systematic support towards the achievement of  common objectives within and \\nacross individual policies\\u2019 (den Hertog and Stross, 2013,4).\\nThe most well-known policy principles and approaches through which environ-\\nmental and climate-related considerations have thus far been integrated into this set \\nof  common objectives across policy initiatives include principles of  Environmental \\nPolicy Integration (EPI) and the more incipient Climate Policy Integration (CPI). The \\nconcept of  EPI first emerged in the 1990s as a lagged response to the urgent need \\nto systematically connect apparently divergent goals, such as economic competitive-\\nness, social development and environmental protection. It has received widespread \\npolitical backing at the international level, but particularly within the EU, where it \\nenjoys a prominent status. It enshrines the notion of  affording \\u2018principled priority\\u2019 to \\nenvironmental objectives vis-\\u00e0-vis other policy areas, rather than merely balancing \\nvarious objectives, ensuring that the \\u2018long-term carrying capacity of  nature becomes a \\nprinciple or overarching societal objective\\u2019 (Jordan and Lenschow, 2010; Lafferty and \\nHovden, 2003, 9). However, despite the EU making some attempts to move beyond \\nthis normative understanding and effectively operationalise the principle of  EPI in \\nthe late 1990s and early 2000s \\u2013 including, for instance, green budgeting, integrated \\npolicy appraisal and impact assessments, and programmatic planning \\u2013 enshrining \\nEPI through a unified structured set of  practices and processes remains elusive. \\nInstead, sector-specific niches of  EPI have emerged, meaning that what EPI looks \\nlike in practice is often situational (Jordan and Lenschow, 2010).

Conceptualisations \\nof  what CPI means both as a normative principle and in practice are fairly divergent \\n(Adelle and Russel, 2013). Many , however, draw heavily on Lafferty and Hovden\\u2019s \\n(2003) definition of  EPI, arguing that CPI is a process giving principled priority to \\nclimate objectives over those of  other policies (Mickwitz et al., 2009). In practice, \\nCPI \\u2013 similarly to EPI \\u2013 has struggled to gain traction, with the literature on how to \\nactually undertake CPI generally lacking. Both the concepts of  EPI and CPI, however, \\nrelate primarily to a broader notion of  mainstreaming, focusing on the integration \\nof  one specific policy area into other areas, rather than seeking to build coherence \\nbetween two specific sectors viewed on equal footing (as in the case of  climate and \\nenvironment- and peace and security-related policy areas).\\nSimilarly , with regards to existing approaches to analysing and evaluating policy \\ncoherence, there is something of  a gap with regards to analysing coherence specifi-\\ncally from the perspective of  climate security . The OECD\\u2019s PCSD framework, for \\nexample \\u2013 arguably one of  the most readily accessible tools for policy- and decision-\\nmakers seeking to improve cross-sectoral coherence and containing analytical, insti-\\ntutional and monitoring components \\u2013 is designed to be flexible and adaptable to \\ndiverse national and institutional contexts, meaning it can be deployed broadly across \\na variety of  policy areas (OECD, 2016). Its analytical component contains evalua-\\ntion criteria related to actors, political leadership, policy interlinkages, enabling and \\ndisabling conditions, sources of  finance and transboundary and intergenerational \\nimpacts. Yet the framework arguably does not contain a sufficient degree of  specificity \\nif  seeking to assess coherence across different policy areas on climate security specifi-\\ncally , currently instead emphasising a set of  normative governance and policymaking \\nnorms and processes \\u2013 visible for example in the emphasis on stakeholder involvement \\nand political leadership \\u2013 rather than analysis of  interactions, synergies or conflicts \\nbetween specific policy and strategy documents (Nilsson et al., 2012).\\nDespite the salience of  ensuring cross-sectoral coherence between climate and \\nenvironment-related and peace and security-related policy areas and on ensuring conflict- \\nand climate-sensitivity within these policy areas respectively , surprisingly little work has \\ntherefore been carried out to analyse policy coherence specifically between these fields. \\nExisting examples of  policy coherence analyses conducted on climate and environment-\\nrelated policy and strategy documents focus variously on coherence between climate \\nand livestock (Ashley , 2019); between climate policy at the national and regional level \\nin specific geographies, such as amongst Small Island Developing States (SIDS) or the \\nCaribbean (Lewis and Su, 2021; Scobie, 2016); between national level adaptation goals \\nand specific sectors (England et al., 2018; Kalaba et al., 2014; Ranabhat et al., 2018); \\nbetween climate and tourism policies (Santos-Lacueva and Velasco Gonz\\u00e1lez, 2018), \\namongst other examples. Specific analysis of  how climate and environment- and peace \\nand security-related policies interact is, however, generally absent.\\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

To test this framework, a diagnostic \\nanalysis is conducted, which \\u2013 grounded in the research questions set out below \\u2013 \\nidentifies trends and patterns in the way sectoral actors across different countries have \\nengaged with the topic of  climate security and the degree to which coherence exists \\nbetween these sectors both horizontally (at the national level) and vertically (between \\nnational and regional levels). Specifically , this paper will seek to answer the following \\nquestions:\\n\\u2022 To what extent are climate and environment- and peace and security-related \\npolicies and strategies \\u2018aware\\u2019 of  the topic of  climate security and specific \\nclimate-related security risks that may exist in intervening contexts?\\n\\u2022 To what extent do policies and strategies that do demonstrate awareness of  \\nclimate-related security risks translate this awareness into strategic priorities and \\nobjectives?\\n\\u2022 To what degree do policies and strategies contain specific programmatic activi-\\nties, projects, and other implementation strategies that are climate security-\\nsensitive and coherent across climate and environment- and peace and security-\\nrelated realms?\\nOn the basis of  this analysis, a set of  recommendations is made to policymakers \\nand planners to further the coherence between policy domains and the effective \\nintegration of  climate-related security risks into policy outputs.\\nMethodology\\nOur method for analysing policy coherence between climate and environment- and \\npeace and security-related policy documents builds upon a variety of  approaches \\nfor assessing and understanding policy coherence, with different approaches often \\nmaking use of  different modalities through which an assessment is undertaken. Our \\nmethod, however, whilst using these previously deployed principled of  policy coher -\\nence analysis, diverges from previous analysis by employing climate security-specific \\nvariables within our assessment framework (Table 1).\\nDifferent existing approaches were considered and incorporated on the basis of  \\nseveral analytical considerations. Firstly , as we hypothesised that the majority of  policy \\nand strategy documents would have very limited engagement or entirely fail to engage \\nwith climate security as a topic and area of  concern, part of  our analysis necessarily \\nfocused on assessing \\u2018awareness\\u2019, or conceptual clarity . Lenschow et al. (2018) refer to \\nthis as assessing synergy or conflict between policies at the level of  \\u2018problem definition\\u2019, \\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

These \\u2018stimulations\\u2019 are here understood to \\noccur through how climate affects human security (in combination with a broader \\nrange of  socio-economic factors, such as poverty , the degree of  support or conversely \\ndiscrimination that a community receives from the state, access to economic opportu-\\nnities, degree of  social cohesion, policy effectiveness, amongst others) in various ways, \\nin essence acting as an intermediary variable between climate change impacts and \\nconflict (Barnett and Adger, 2007; Daoudy , 2021).\\nSecondly , a distinction was made between climate security awareness, coherence at \\nthe strategic level and objective-setting components, and coherence at the implemen-\\ntation level and implementation-related components of  a policy or strategy . Nilsson \\net al. (2012), for instance, understand an assessment of  coherence to encompass policy \\noutputs \\u2013 \\u2018the decisions on objectives and instruments that are meant to achieve policy \\ngoals\\u2019 \\u2013 and policy implementation, or \\u2018the arrangements by authorities and other \\nactors for putting policy instruments into action\\u2019 (Nilsson et al., 2012:  3). Schnabel \\nand Witt (2022) similarly distinguish between policy coherence at the strategic level \\n\\u2013 including strategic orientation and planning activities \\u2013 and the implementation \\nlevel, encompassing the instruments and specific activities outlined in a given policy or \\nstrategy . As such, our method evaluates coherence at the strategic and objective-setting \\nlevel \\u2013 such as whether specific objectives relating to climate security , or the mitigation \\nof  climate-related security risks are present across different policies or strategies \\u2013 as \\nwell as at the implementation level. For the latter, our method evaluates the presence \\nand coherence of  policy instruments (either entirely new ones created for the purpose \\nof  climate security or the integration of  climate security considerations into existing \\nones), specific programmatic activities outlined in action plans, and the identification \\nof  specific communities or beneficiaries at risk of  climate-related security risks (Table \\n1). Importantly , coding was centred around both implicit and explicit climate security \\nconsiderations. This means that for instance an objective or programmatic activity \\nwhich did not explicitly address climate-related security risks \\u2013 but which indirectly \\ncontributed to the mitigation of  said risks, for instance through engaging in climate \\nsmart agricultural (CSA) practices and thereby reducing livelihood insecurity \\u2013 was \\ncoded as implicitly contributing to the mitigation of  climate-related security risks and \\nthereby forming an opportunity for further integration of  climate-related security \\nconsiderations.\\nThirdly , our method enables the evaluation of  policy and strategic coherence both \\nhorizontally (at the same level of  governance) and vertically (across different levels of  \\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

This is in line with den Hertog and Stross (2013), who \\u2013 in their analysis \\nof  EU law and foreign policy \\u2013 emphasise the need for a multi-level understanding of  \\ncoherence and to examine its achievement in both a horizontal and a vertical sense. \\nInterconnections between policies and strategies at different levels are as such assessed \\nthrough whether a policy or strategy document makes reference to or builds upon \\na policy or strategy produced at a different level of  governance (restricted to either \\nregional or national levels within this paper) (Table 1).\\nThe method used for evaluating awareness of  climate-related security risks and \\ncoherence between the policy areas included in this analysis was designed in a hybrid \\nmanner, cognisant of  the fact that whilst empirical results were required for effective \\ncross-comparison of  trends, patterns and results, policy analysis remains a qualitative \\nand subjective analytical exercise. The method was also created to possess sufficient \\nspecificity to produce useful insights with regards to which thematic or technical areas \\na policy output or strategy could be argued to fall short in. As such, the hybrid frame-\\nwork is composed of  both directed content analysis and an empirical scoring system, \\nwith the former acting as the foundations for the latter. Directed content analysis \\ncan be utilised to validate or extend conceptually a pre-existing theoretical frame-\\nwork or theory , and is therefore useful in the ex-ante creation of  analytical categories \\nthrough which bodies of  text can be assessed (Hsieh and Shannon, 2005). In line \\nwith our research questions and building on previous understandings and assessments \\nof  coherence within existing literature, a number of  analytical categories were thus \\ncreated to analyse coherence in a deductive manner (Table 1).\\nEach of  the categories outlined in Table 1 therefore represents a domain deemed \\nof  relevance for coherence and the adequate incorporation of  climate-related security \\nrisks, based on which an evaluation could be made by the researchers. To do so in a \\nway that produced empirical and quantifiable results, one to two questions were devel-\\noped within each category which the researcher would answer with either a \\u2018yes\\u2019 or a \\n\\u2018no\\u2019 (corresponding to a 1 or a 0 respectively). This subsequently formed the basis of  \\na policy scoring system in which the lowest attainable score is 0 and the highest is 12.\\nTo ensure the validity of  our results, we deployed a number of  quality assur -\\nance techniques at various stages of  the analysis. Firstly , it was important to consider \\nwhether the concepts and categories we developed were adequately reflective of  \\nthe phenomenon under assessment. To ensure this, a small sub-set of  the selected \\ndocuments (around 15\\u201320 per cent) were utilised to check the appropriateness of  the \\ncategorisations, after which a series of  small adjustments were made to the framework \\n(Islam and Asadullah, 2018). These adjustments mainly centred around clarifying and \\nnarrowing the assessment criteria, such as establishing what exactly constituted an \\nacceptable definition of  climate security , what represented recognition of  specific \\nclimate-conflict linkages within policy documents, and how to define what comprised \\nan implicit contribution to the mitigation of  climate-related security risks.

Due to the complex feedback processes that exist between climate \\nchange and climate vulnerability on the one hand and conflict and fragility on the \\nother, these contexts in particular are arguably at high risk of  becoming locked into \\nhard-to-break cycles of  climate vulnerability , insecurity and conflict. Addressing these \\ninterlinkages in policy and maximising the co-benefits of  climate action, conflict \\nprevention and peacebuilding is therefore acute. The rationale for focusing on Africa \\ndraws from the increasing interest on the topic in the continent as illustrated by the \\nBamako Declaration on Access to Natural Resources and Conflicts between Commu-\\nnities released in 2019 in which the African Union acknowledged the interconnec-\\ntions between climate and conflict and called for the need to develop effective policy \\nresponses to address these interconnected risks (African Union Peace and Security \\nCouncil, 2019).\\nIn order to identify and extract relevant policy and strategy documents produced \\nby national governments and regional level entities, a keyword search strategy was \\ndeveloped based on the key concepts identified by the research questions. Boolean \\noperators were used to help enhance and narrow down the keyword search by estab-\\nlishing relationships between the different terms through the use of  the connector \\n\\u2018 AND\\u2019, used to only retrieve the documents that mention all of  the terms included \\nin the search (for instance, searching for \\u2018climate\\u2019 AND \\u2018policy\\u2019 AND \\u2018[country]\\u2019). \\nThese Boolean operators were deployed in the New Climate Institute\\u2019s Climate Policy \\nDatabase and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environ-\\nment\\u2019s Climate Change Laws of  the World Database, as well as throughout relevant \\nclimate and environment- and peace and security-related ministerial websites across \\nthe eight countries subjected to analysis. A set of  inclusion and exclusion criteria \\nfor extracted policy and strategy documents was subsequently developed based on \\nthe thematic priorities identified by the research questions, and helped establish the \\nsectoral, temporal and geographical scope of  the analysis. The scope of  analysis was \\nlimited to policy and strategy documents extracted from climate and environment-\\nrelated fields climate change fields (i.e. adaptation and mitigation) and from peace \\nand security-related fields (e.g. social cohesion, conflict prevention/transformation, \\nand peacebuilding; counterterrorism and extremist prevention; stabilisation and post-\\nconflict recovery).\\nThese inclusion criteria were developed as the scope of  this research is focused on \\nassessing awareness of  and coherence on climate security specifically within climate \\nand environment- and peace and security-related policies and strategies. Although \\u2013 \\nas we identified previously \\u2013 climate-related security risks are frequently cross-sectoral \\nand cross-scalar in nature, we consider coherence and synergies between climate and \\nenvironment- and peace and security-related policies as the primary entry point for \\nintegrated climate-peace programming.

For the \\npurposes of  this paper, a climate security-relevant policy field is therefore defined \\nas climate and environment, peace and security , development, agriculture, natural \\nresource management and disaster risk reduction. Only documents published after \\n2010 were included in the analysis in order both to assure their continued relevancy , \\nand to reflect the fact that the topic and field of  climate security remains nascent, \\nsuggesting that older documents would not contain references to the nexus and there-\\nfore be of  limited analytical utility .\\nSome limitations of  the analysis include that we do not analyse or evaluate policy \\neffectiveness or the degree to which implementation has truly occurred, which is \\nbeyond the scope of  this analysis. Additionally , due to our dataset being limited to \\npolicies and strategies available and accessible online, documents potentially missed by \\nour keyword search strategy are not included in the dataset. Our analysis is therefore \\nnot necessarily exhaustive. Finally , we recognise the limitations inherent to deploying \\na binary scoring system. Whilst utilising a binary coding method simplifies the coding \\nprocess, to some extent removes inter-coder variability and potential differences in \\ninterpretation, and facilitates using a larger dataset, there are also shortcomings. \\nThese primarily include the fact that the varying extent to which different policies and \\nstrategies may engage with climate-conflict linkages, for instance, is not captured. A \\nsingular instance of  engagement was considered as sufficient to fulfil the requirements \\nof  our framework, therefore removing a degree of  nuance with regards to which \\npolicies substantially engage with climate-conflict linkages versus those that engage \\nonly limitedly with the topic.

Peace and \\nsecurity-related policies and strategies were slightly more likely to deploy a concep-\\ntually appropriate understanding (25 per cent of  national level and 10 per cent of  \\nregional level documents).\\nSimilarly , recognition of  differing rates of  change within climate- and socio-\\neconomic, political and development processes \\u2013 and how this may impact the \\nemergence of  climate-related security risks \\u2013 was extremely rare, with only 2 per cent \\nof  climate and environment-related and no peace and security-related policies and \\nstrategies displaying evidence of  awareness regarding this, across both the assessed \\nscales of  governance (temporal coherence) (Table 2). It is also notable that at both the \\nnational and the regional level, climate and environment-related policies and strategies \\nwere much more likely to recognise specific climate-related security risks or conflict \\noutcomes than peace and security-related documents, although they were slightly less \\nlikely to make use of  a conceptually sound understanding of  climate security . Overall, \\ntherefore, awareness of  how climate may affect conflict risk in specific contexts is to \\nsome degree present, however, the usage of  a clear conceptual understanding and \\ncross-sectoral coherence with regards to a shared conceptual basis across climate and \\nenvironment- and peace and security-related policies and strategies is limited.\\nClimate security-sensitive strategic priorities and objectives\\nSecondly , with regards to our second research question on the degree to which climate \\nsecurity features at the strategic level of  analysed policies and strategies \\u2013 and the extent \\nto which these are present across climate- and environment and peace and security-\\nrelated sectors \\u2013 it is evident that whilst cross-sectoral policy interaction is present, \\nclimate security coherence at the strategic level is limited. 80 per cent of  national level \\nand 67 per cent of  regional level climate and environment-related policies were, for \\ninstance, recorded as in some way referencing or recognising interconnections with \\nanother policy area relevant to climate security at the same level of  governance (Table \\n2). Peace and security-related policies and strategies were slightly less likely to do so (56 \\nper cent of  national level policies and 50 per cent of  regional level policies) (horizontal \\nacknowledgement 1). Policies and strategies were much less likely , however, to engage \\nwith a specific policy or strategy from another policy sector, suggesting that where \\ninterconnections are made, they are primarily at the surface level, without necessarily \\nexploring specific strategic- or implementation-related interconnections (horizontal \\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

Notable again here is the fact that climate and environment-\\nrelated policies are more likely to have horizontal cross-sectoral interactions than \\npeace and security-related policies.\\nThis trend continues with regards to vertical coherence, with the vast majority \\nof  climate and environment-related policies and strategies referencing a policy area \\nrelevant to climate security at a different level of  governance (91 per cent of  national \\nlevel and 93 per cent of  regional level documents). Only 6 per cent of  national level \\nand 60 per cent of  regional level peace and security-related policies, however, did the \\nsame.

Forty-five per cent of  national level and 40 per cent of  \\nregional level climate and environment-related policies \\u2013 as well as 32 per cent of  \\nnational level peace and security-related policies \\u2013 were found to contain activities and \\nprogrammatic interventions either explicitly or implicitly related to climate security . \\nRegional level peace and security-related policies and strategies were the least likely \\nto contain specific programmatic interventions related directly or indirectly to climate \\nsecurity . Finally , climate and environment-related policies and strategies demonstrated \\na greater tendency to identify specific communities and geographies at risk of  climate \\nchange impacts or climate-related security risks. Thirty-nine per cent of  national \\nand 33 per cent of  regional climate and environment-related policies and strategies \\ndisplayed the level of  granularity needed to truly undertake responsive programming, \\nwhilst only 19 per cent of  national level and 10 per cent of  regional level peace and \\nsecurity-related policies and strategies did so. It should be noted, however, that despite \\nclimate and environment-related generally outperforming peace and security-related \\npolicies and strategies in all of  the implementation-related evaluation categories, the \\noverall presence of  instruments, specific programmatic interventions, and the degree \\nto which specific at risk-communities and geographies were identified in a climate \\nsecurity-relevant manner is low. Regional level peace and security-related policies \\nperformed particularly poorly in this regard.\\nDiscussion and recommendations\\nFirstly , it is apparent that whilst both climate and environment- and peace and \\nsecurity-related policies and strategies do engage with (and demonstrate awareness \\nof) specific climate-conflict linkages, these are much less likely to be underpinned \\nby a robust conceptual understanding of  the concept of  climate security . Although \\nclimate-related conflict and security implications are quite regularly recognised as \\nbeing present in intervening contexts, the frequent absence of  a clear and workable \\ndefinition of  climate security perhaps indicates a lack of  appropriate frameworks of  \\nunderstanding for how climate change may undermine human security (and how \\nresponses to alleviating said insecurity can contribute to conflict and violence). It \\nis also the case, however, that climate and environment-related policies are at both \\nthe national and regional level more likely to contain recognition of  climate-conflict \\nlinkages. The fact that a shared conceptual understanding is often lacking amongst \\npolicies and strategies of  both policy areas additionally limits opportunities for cross-\\nsectoral coherence, as policymakers active in different policy spaces are not able to \\noperate within the same conceptual framing. A broad and crucially shared concep-\\ntual basis facilitates the ability for a common problem definition, and can therefore \\nhelp inform the design of  policies and programming able to mitigate the potential \\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

Academic \\nand practitioner fields have, however, thus far struggled to facilitate cross-fertilisation \\nbetween competing ontological positions, epistemological foundations and method-\\nological approaches on the relationship between climate change and violent conflict \\n(Ide et al., 2023), which may also influence and prohibit the development of  effective \\npolicy .\\nSecondly , our results suggest that climate and environment-related policies and \\nstrategies are generally more likely to recognise specific instances of  climate-conflict \\nlinkages; display interconnectedness with either other sector-specific policie0s and \\nstrategies or overarching development and growth strategies; contain objectives and \\nstrategic priorities at least implicitly related to mitigating climate-related security risks \\n(therefore displaying the greatest opportunity for integrating climate security-related \\nconcerns); and outline specific programmatic activities and projects either directly or \\nindirectly related to mitigating climate-related security risks. Peace and security-related \\npolicies \\u2013 both at the national and regional levels, but particularly the latter \\u2013 are far \\nless likely to engage with other sectors or display integration into overarching, cross-\\nsectoral strategies or contain opportunities for the integration of  climate security-\\nrelated considerations at the strategic and implementation levels. Whilst current \\ncross-sectoral policy linkages therefore do not appear to be sufficiently present for an \\neffective, integrated approach to climate security policymaking, regional peace and \\nsecurity-related strategies in particular currently display very minimal opportunity \\nfor the incorporation of  climate security . These results may partially , however, be a \\nreflection of  the fact that less peace and security-related policies and strategies were \\nextracted and included in the dataset used for this analysis than climate and environ-\\nment-related policies.\\nThirdly , it is apparent that \\u2013 despite evidence for a sophisticated understanding \\nof  climate security being limited \\u2013 the potential for climate security-related consid-\\nerations to be integrated into existing objectives, strategic priorities, policy instru-\\nments, baseline assessments and identifying at risk areas and groups, and specific \\nprogrammes and projects does exist. A substantial number of  objectives, the policy \\ninstruments used to transpose these to local levels, and the local level programmes and \\nactivities that help achieve priorities locally , were found to implicitly mitigate climate-\\nrelated security risks and pathways, primarily by seeking to alleviate climate-related \\nimpacts on human security . Consideration of  co-benefits for peace, security and \\nsocial cohesion, however, is limited in the vast majority of  these instances. It there-\\nfore appears that policy- and decisionmakers face challenges in transforming their \\nawareness of  climate security and specific manifestations of  the relationship between \\nclimate change and conflict into credible and coherent policy responses to challenge \\nthe complex interconnections between climate change, insecurity and conflict.\\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

Firstly , it is imperative that both academic and practitioner litera-\\nture achieves a greater degree of  conceptual clarity on how to frame and operation-\\nalise the relationship between climate change and violent conflict (Ide et al., 2023). \\nOur research has shown that this likely extends beyond the purely academic realm \\nand represents more than an intellectual exercise. There may therefore be utility for \\npolicymakers from across climate and environment- and peace and security-related \\npolicy areas to access a shared conceptual space where interconnections and synergies \\nbetween climate and security can be explored and maximised, particularly in identi-\\nfying specific programmes, projects or initiatives where climate and conflict sensitivity \\nand peace responsiveness could be better integrated.\\nInnovation and the scaling-up of  innovative developments within the field of  \\nclimate security (including the development of  climate security-specific programmatic \\ninterventions) requires the buy-in of  a multitude of  interconnected and interdepen-\\ndent stakeholders active in the space that can form coalitions of  change (Sartas et al., \\n2020). For climate security , these are likely to include (but not necessarily be limited \\nto) researchers from across diverse epistemologies, both climate action and peace \\npractitioners, multilateral institutions, states and sub-national and community-level \\norganisations. The construction of  these coalitions requires stakeholders being able to \\nlearn about one another\\u2019s context and perspectives, discover how they depend on one \\nanother to fulfil their ambitions, develop common starting points to build upon, and \\ndevelop mutual relationships and trust (Kahan and Rapoport, 2014). This facilitated \\nlearning and negotiation process cannot occur, however, without these diverse stake-\\nholders operating on the basis of  a common definition and using a widely accepted \\nset of  terms, approaches, frameworks and data types \\u2013 the absence of  which is clear \\non the basis of  our policy analysis. Ensuring a unified conceptual base is therefore a \\nkey priority for government actors within the field of  climate security .\\nGiven how context-specific recognition of  climate-conflict linkages is to some \\ndegree present however, it is also critical for academics and practitioners to strengthen \\ntheir ability to learn from the policy community itself  (and those informing the policy-\\nmaking process). In particular, researcher and practitioner communities should invest \\nto a much greater degree in localised and bottom-up knowledge co-creation processes. \\nThis has proved challenging, however, given the limited availability of  information \\nand data that can help paint a picture of  specific local dynamics and the variables and \\ndrivers involved in them. A greater emphasis should therefore be placed on working \\ntogether with relevant government agencies, sub-national and community-level struc-\\ntures to co-define climate-related security risks and co-design potential interventions \\nto address these, underscoring the importance of  knowledge co-creation and decolo-\\nnising the field of  climate security (Siddiqi, 2022).\\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

Policymaking actors \\nand institutions active in the peace and security space in particular should therefore \\nmore actively consider the role of  climate change in contributing to risks of  conflict \\nand threats to social cohesion, whilst also reflecting to a much greater degree the \\nopportunities climate change may bring for cooperation in their strategic priorities, \\nobjectives and programmatic activities. Furthermore, as our results suggest that cross-\\nsectoral interaction between peace and security-related policies and strategies and \\nother policy areas is much more limited than is the case for climate and environment-\\nrelated policies, there is a need to construct more robust cross-sectoral linkages and \\nmake sure of  existing vehicles and spaces for coordination for the purposes of  climate \\nsecurity coordination. One practical method through which a greater awareness of  \\nthe relationship between climate change and conflict amongst those working in peace \\nand security could be to, firstly , undertake training needs assessments (TNAs) within \\nkey country and regional level bodies and entities in order to assess gaps in under -\\nstanding, skills or capacities with regards to the topic of  climate security . This should \\nbe followed, secondly , by specific climate security-related capacity building efforts to \\nrespond to potential shortcomings in understanding and capacity .\\nFinally , as our analysis suggests that (particularly in climate and environment-\\nrelated policies and strategies) the opportunity for incorporating climate security-\\nrelated considerations and priorities is quite substantial, efforts to chart how and to \\nintegrate co-benefits for peace, security and social cohesion into existing program-\\nmatic activities and projects should be undertaken in a systemic manner. To do so, \\nthose working in technical capacities within relevant ministries, agencies and other \\npolicymaking entities could engage in internal analytical and mapping exercises such \\nas those outlined by Morales-Mu\\u00f1oz et al. (2022) Making use of  a system dynamics \\nmodel and creating causal loop diagrams can, for example, can help chart context-\\nspecific relationships with the climate-conflict and climate-peace nexus, the interme-\\ndiate variables that influence the intensity and speed at which said relationships may \\nmanifest, and identify correlations and feedbacks between these (both positive and \\nnegative). This in turn would allow climate and environment- as well as peace and \\nsecurity-related institutions and entities to identify exactly where in this complex set of  \\nrelationships they are likely able to either amplify positive or mitigate negative correla-\\ntions between climate change and social systems, and which specific programmatic \\nactivities may be required to do so. Integrating such exercises at the very beginning of  \\na policy formulation process can help better integrate climate security considerations \\nin a systematic manner. Furthermore, incorporating a more diverse set of  experts and \\nexpert organisations into said policy design and formulation stages \\u2013 including those \\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

To do so, it makes use of  an innovative policy analysis method designed to \\ncapture and evaluate analytical variables that are specifically relevant to assessing \\nthe presence of  climate security-related considerations in the policy documents, as \\nwell as the degree to which coherence appears to exist across climate and environ-\\nment- and peace and security-related fields. Using this method, this paper finds that \\nalthough specific climate-conflict linkages are to a certain extent recognised within \\npolicies from both sectors, a clear and shared conceptual understanding of  climate \\nsecurity is mostly lacking; climate and environment-related policies and strategies are \\ngenerally more aware of  climate security and have greater cross-sectoral linkages than \\npeace and security-related policies and strategies, which appear to operate in a more \\nsiloed manner; and that there are \\u2013 particularly within climate and environment-\\nrelated policies and strategies \\u2013 opportunities for the integration of  climate security-\\nrelated considerations into existing objectives and strategic priorities, instruments \\nand programmatic activities and projects. As a consequence of  these findings, this \\npaper recommends that academic and practitioner climate security research fields \\nwork to achieve a greater degree of  conceptual clarity and cooperates more effec-\\ntively with government agencies, sub-national entities and communities to generate \\ncontext-specific understandings of  climate security; that peace and security policy-\\nmaking institutions \\u2013 particularly at the regional level \\u2013 undertake internal TNAs to \\nassess shortcomings in knowledge and capacities with regard to climate security and \\ndesign capacity building efforts as appropriate; and that current opportunities for the \\nintegration of  climate security-related considerations and climate-peace co-benefits \\nare identified more clearly through the use of  exercises such as system dynamics \\nmodelling, which can be included in the policy design and formulation process.\\nDownloaded from www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk by Guest on October 24, 2023.\\nFor personal use only.

      "The increasing interconnected nature of our world means that failing to achieve coherence between climate- and peace and security-related policy domains forms a significant climate-related security risk. Poorly designed climate policies that are insensitive to pre-existing insecurities and conflict dynamics may undermine political stability, amplify social inequalities and grievances, and accelerate a loss of biodiversity and climate change-related impacts. Peace and security policies that do not account for climate risks may conversely promote ineffective and unresponsive interventions and risk locking communities into vicious cycles of insecurity and climate vulnerability. This work contributes to the climate security proofing of policy outputs by developing a methodological framework that assesses the degree to which policy outputs and strategy documents display awareness of climate-related security risks and climate peace opportunities. This framework is used to assess policies and strategies from across eight African countries. We find that despite some limited recognition of often place-specific climate-related security risks, a clear and shared conceptual understanding of the climate, peace and security nexus is generally lacking; climate and environment-related policies are generally more aware of climate security and have greater cross-sectoral engagement than peace and security-related policies; and that opportunities exist for the integration of climate security-related considerations into existing strategic priorities, instruments, and programmatic activities.\n",

      "The evidence presented describes a project that developed a methodological framework to assess the degree to which policy outputs and strategy documents in eight African countries display awareness of climate-related security risks and climate peace opportunities. The key activities carried out include:\n",

      "- Developing a methodological framework to assess the climate security sensitivity of policies and strategies from climate/environment and peace/security sectors. The framework evaluates awareness, strategic coherence, and implementation coherence.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "- Finding that despite some recognition of climate-conflict linkages, a clear conceptual understanding of climate security is lacking. Climate/environment policies demonstrate greater awareness and cross-sectoral engagement than peace/security policies.  \n",

The analysis of African policies revealed limited conceptual coherence on climate security but identified opportunities to further integrate climate considerations into objectives and activities, especially in climate/environment policies. The findings underscore the need for greater conceptual clarity on climate security and more robust cross-sectoral linkages between climate/environment and peace/security policies.\n",
